 A plume of smoke emits from a fire that broke out at a Chevron oil refinery in Richmond, California August 6, 2012. 
 
 RICHMOND/HOUSTON (Reuters) - A massive fire struck at the core of Chevron Corp's large Richmond, California, refinery on Monday, spewing flames and a column of smoke into the air, threatening a prolonged outage that may increase prices of the costliest U.S. gasoline. 
 
 The fire was contained, but not extinguished, according to the company. The fire has blazed for hours after it erupted at the refinery in a densely populated industrial suburb of San Francisco. Smoke could be seen billowing over the Bay Area and four train stations were shut. 
 
 Nearby residents were ordered indoors after the fire hit the sole crude unit at the 245,000 barrel per day (bpd) plant, which accounts for one-eighth of California state's refining capacity. About 200 people have sought medical help, complaining of respiratory problems, the San Pablo, California-based Doctors Medical Center said in a statement. 
 
 The fire had started in the No. 4 crude unit, the only one at the plant, at 6:15 p.m. shortly after a leak was discovered, Chevron said. As the leak grew, workers were evacuated, plant manager Nigel Hearn told journalists at the site. He said some units were still operating, but gave no details. 
 
 It was not immediately clear when the fire would be put out and the extent of damage to the plant was not known. 
 
 "I walked outside and saw what looked like a lot of steam coming out of Chevron, way more than usual. I thought they must have blown a boiler," said Ryan Lackay, a 45-year-old employee at a chemical plant next door to the refinery. 
 
 "And then all of a sudden it just went whoosh, it ignited." 
 
 Crude distillation units (CDUs) break down oil into feedstock for other units in a refinery. It can take months to repair a CDU at a large plant, during which operations are typically severely limited. 
 
 Any lengthy disruption in production could affect the supply of fuel in the West Coast, particularly gasoline, due to the difficulty in meeting California's super-clean specifications. The region also has few immediate alternative supply sources. 
 
 "Chevron will have a hard time finding replacement barrels in an already short market," said Bob van der Valk, a petroleum industry analyst in Terry, Montana. 
 
 "Refineries are already drawing down summer blend inventory in anticipation of the switch back to winter blend gasoline." 
 
 TOWERING FLAMES, BLACK SMOKE 
 
 Residents of Richmond were advised to "shelter in place", an order often given during refinery accidents to shield against possible exposure to toxic chemicals or smoke. Sulfuric acid and nitrogen dioxide were released during the incident, according to a filing with the California Emergency Management Agency. 
 
 The refinery, the third largest in California and among the oldest in the country, is key to the economy of Richmond, a declining industrial city. But it has stirred controversy among local residents concerned about the environmental impacts and local politicians often seeking more tax revenues. 
 
 "I looked out the window and saw 40 foot flames and black smoke," Marc Mowrey, a Point Richmond resident who lives about a mile from the plant, said in a telephone interview. 
 
 He said the smell was not exceptional or very different from other days, but a huge plume of smoke was sitting over Richmond and neighboring El Cerrito. 
 
 Chevron said in a statement that there had been only one minor injury at the refinery, which at its peak 10 years ago employed over 1,300 people on a site of over 2,900 acres. 
 
 Last week, the refinery reported vapor leaks and a compressor failure to California pollution regulators, according to notices. The notices did not say which units were involved. 
 
 We are "very disappointed that this happened, and apologize that we are inconveniencing our neighbors," Chevron spokesman Walt Gill told local television. 
 
 A Reuters reporter who lives nearby said he heard some loud bangs and a siren as the fire erupted, but a Chevron spokesman denied reports of an explosion. 
 
 It is common to shut down the entire plant in the event of a major blaze. A February 17 fire at the CDU of BP Plc's 225,000 bpd Cherry Point, Washington, refinery led to a three-month shutdown and sent the regional price premium to more than $1 a gallon in some places.

 Updated at 8:05 a.m. ET: A massive fire struck at the core of Chevron's large Richmond, Calif., refinery on Monday, spewing flames and a column of smoke into the air, and threatening a prolonged outage that may increase prices of U.S. gasoline. 
 
 The fire was contained by 11 p.m. (2 a.m. ET), according to the company. The fire blazed for hours after it erupted at the refinery in a densely populated industrial suburb east of San Francisco. Smoke could be seen billowing over the Bay Area and four train stations were shut. 
 
 Thousands of local residents were ordered to stay indoors and shut all windows and doors after the fire hit the sole crude unit at the 245,000 barrel per day plant, which accounts for one-eighth of California state's refining capacity. But that order was later lifted. 
 
 "I heard a big boom ... then the alarms started going off," 23-year-old local resident Daniela Rodriguez told the Contra Costa Times. 
 
 "I was getting kind of scared. I went into my backyard and could see a big, dark gray cloud. I saw it was coming from where the refinery is, so I told my mom to lock the windows," the newspaper quoted her as saying.

 The plume from the fire reached an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 feet above ground level, officials said at a news conference, according to the Times. 
 
 No fatalities 
 
 All workers had been accounted for and no fatalities were reported, but one employee was treated at an on-site clinic for burns to his wrist, the San Francisco Chronicle said. 
 
 About 200 people have sought medical help, complaining of respiratory problems, the San Pablo, Calif.-based Doctors Medical Center said in a statement. 
 
 "They told me I'm not going to die, but it sure feels pretty serious," 21-year-old Richmond resident Julius Bailey told the Chronicle after seeing a doctor for respiratory complaints at Kaiser’s Richmond Medical Center.

 Thousands of East Bay residents were ordered to stay in their homes with the windows and doors closed Monday night after a series of explosions and fires tore through Chevron's Richmond refinery. 
 
 The explosions started about 6:15 p.m., and at least two large fires spewed thick, black smoke into the darkening sky. 
 
 The fire started at the refinery's No. 4 Crude Unit, Chevron officials said. Just before 6:30 p.m., an inspection crew discovered that there was a diesel leak in a line in the unit - and that the leak was growing. 
 
 Shortly after the crew evacuated the area, the diesel ignited, said Nigel Hearne, manager of the refinery. 
 
 All employees had been accounted for and there were no fatalities, but one refinery worker suffered burns to his wrist and was treated at the on-site clinic. 
 
 About five minutes after the explosions, sirens tore through the air, alerting residents to stay indoors to prevent breathing tainted air. Some people got in their cars and drove away from the smoke that spread throughout the neighborhoods east of the refinery. 
 
 "Everybody evacuated so fast people's car alarms were going off," said Sara Monares, 55, who lives a short distance from the refinery. 
 
 Health officials' main concern was fumes from crude oil and diesel fuel, but winds were carrying the smoke and pollutants skyward, said Maria Duazo, a hazardous materials specialist with the Contra Costa County Health Services Department. 
 
 A shelter-in-place warning was issued for Richmond, North Richmond and San Pablo and remained in effect late Monday. An advisory for those with lung conditions or a sensitivity to smoke to stay indoors was expanded to all of Contra Costa County. Residents as far away as the Oakland hills were being warned by police about smoke heading that way. 
 
 Air samples taken 
 
 As the smoke stretched out over the El Cerrito hills, Contra Costa County hazardous materials units rolled through the neighborhoods, taking air samples. 
 
 Trisha Asuncion, hazardous materials specialist with Contra Costa County, said that no hazardous compounds had been detected in the air, but that monitoring would continue. 
 
 Kaiser's Richmond Medical Center said several dozen people came to the emergency room Monday night complaining of shortness of breath, but none was seriously ill. 
 
 Julius Bailey, 21, who lives on Barrett Avenue in Richmond, blocks away from the refinery, was at the hospital wearing a face mask. He said his throat had started burning and his eyes itching. After seeing a doctor, he said, "They told me I'm not going to die, but it sure feels pretty serious." 
 
 BART closed the Richmond, El Cerrito del Norte and El Cerrito Plaza stations at about 7 p.m., and shut down service between Richmond and El Cerrito and Richmond and North Berkeley about 30 minutes later. Only the Richmond Station remained closed late Monday. 
 
 Toll takers on the westbound Richmond-San Rafael Bridge were told to take shelter because of the fire, said Officer Ralph Caggiano, a California Highway Patrol spokesman. He said he wasn't sure whether cash-paying drivers would get a free trip, but drivers with FasTrak were still being charged tolls. 
 
 Previous fires 
 
 The Chevron Richmond refinery was founded more than a century ago and is Northern California's largest, capable of processing more than 242,000 barrels of oil each day. It is the third-largest refinery in the state. A prolonged closure could push up gasoline prices, which are already rising nationwide because of a rally in the market for crude oil. 
 
 The refinery has suffered fires before. In January of 2007, the seal on a pump in a crude unit failed, triggering a fire that lasted almost 10 hours. 
 
 David Rorai, 60, was working as a welder for Chevron about a decade ago when another explosion injured several workers. 
 
 "On that last one, we ran like hell," he said, as he stood watching the smoke from Monday night's fires. "We got in our cars and left. I feel for those guys in there right now." Rorai said danger is just a fact of the job when you work around explosive gases. 
 
 "You got to figure if the guy next to you didn't clear his line right or wasn't being careful, that's it for you," he said. "Comes with the job." 
 
 Chevron has for years wanted to overhaul and upgrade the facility. But many Richmond residents and environmentalists have objected, saying the project would create more air pollution in a community that already has too much. Although Richmond's City Council approved the renovation project in 2008, a judge halted construction work the next year, ruling that Chevron had not answered key questions in the project's environmental impact report. 
 
 Monday night, along a fence line on Barrett Avenue in Richmond, a dozen children and teenagers stood fixated, covering their mouths with their shirts as they watched the smoke pour into the sky. They said they had never seen anything like this in their lives. 
 
 "When I heard the booms, I was scared and hid because I thought it was grenades," said Dai'lonie Fuller, 12. "I'm just here to get a look, and then I'm staying inside." 
 
 Under the spreading plume of smoke sat the Christian Home Missionary Church, about a block from the fence. While one singer coughed, the dozen-woman choir sang, despite evacuation orders, their urgent gospel music filling the empty street outside. 
 
 "We've got a funeral to sing at tomorrow, and that doesn't wait," said Laura Young, 65. "We're trying to do what we've got to do." 
 
 The song they were singing was "God Will Take Care of You." 
 
 The fire dwindled down to a few thin twists of smoke by about 8:30 p.m., but flames still flickered beyond what observers could see from the perimeter. Chevron officials said crews were fighting the blaze with nitrogen and steam to keep it cool, but had no estimate as to when it would be extinguished. 
 
 By 8:45 p.m., the winds shifted to the west, blowing the smoke away from the city and into the bay, said Greg Lawler, a health services hazardous materials specialist for Contra Costa County. 
 
 Ken Workman, 47, stood on Macdonald Avenue, peeking through the fence at the fire and shaking his head. He has lived a couple of blocks away since 1987 and said he thinks the refinery doesn't do enough to protect local residents. 
 
 "The wind never blows that smoke to Marin County, now does it?" he said. "They made sure of that. I think it's intentional that they don't protect us."
