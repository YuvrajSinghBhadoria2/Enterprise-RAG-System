 "Never before needed a Heimlich at halftime. (Or any time)!" Fowler posted Saturday. "thanks Jesse Palmer! He saved me from death by dry chicken sandwich. Really." 
 
 Fowler was doing play-by-play for the game at Yankee Stadium between Notre Dame and Rutgers. Palmer, the former Florida and New York Giants quarterback, was the analyst. Both live in New York, so the Pinstripe Bowl is home game for them. 
 
 Fowler also posted: "Not bad to have quick thinking, ex-NFL player around when Heimlich needed. I'll take bruised ribs to avoid choking!" ||||| Tweet with a location
