 Punters are asked to part with as much as £800 to access one of two ‘smoke and mirrors’ booths inside the venue to ogle female patrons. 
 
 The resulting fracas forced the Shimmy Club to issue a statement on Facebook saying: “The Shimmy Club’s two-way mirror is a design feature created as a bit of fun, an interactive feature which we hoped would act as a talking point for people visiting The Shimmy. The vast majority of people who have visited the club have taken it as such. 
 
 “God help us when they find out that we have buried vibrators into sections of the dancefloor...............” 
 
 This failed to appease many, including Kirsty Cunningham who responded: “The most cringe-worthy bit of PR I've witnessed in years!! To the people comparing a two-way mirror (which faces exclusively into the ladies bathroom) to a unisex wash area, you sound like idiots. The signage provided to inform girls of this is barely noticeable and, realistically, after a few drinks how often do people pay attention to all the little notices dotted around a club?”
