 DUMFRIES, Va. (WUSA9) -- A police impersonator tried to pull over an off-duty officer early Thursday morning, police said. 
 
 An off-duty police officer says he was driving on Benita Fitzgerald Drive in Dumfries when a man driving a Crown Victoria started to follow him. The officer says the driver turned on a spotlight that was attached to his car. Thinking it was a police officer, the off-duty officer pulled over, according to police. 
 
 The driver of the Crown Victoria pulled alongside the off-duty officer and tried to make contact, police said. 
 
 When the off-duty officer said he was a police officer, the other driver immediately sped away. The off-duty officer followed the car, and then the driver and passenger fled on foot. 
 
 Police have identified the man as Shawn Michael Robinson, 27, of Alexandria. He turned himself into police after a warrant was issued for his arrest. 
 
 Robinson is being held without bond. He is due in court on March 4.
