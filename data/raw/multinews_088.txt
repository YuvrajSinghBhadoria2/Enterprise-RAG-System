The game shares its name with a song West released two years ago, speaking from the point of view of his late mother after the birth of his daughter. West showed a short reel of dreamy footage from the game that, true to his word, depicts his mother flying through clouds and traveling on the back of what appears to be a Pegasus. It's not much to go off of, but he says it's a game and that he was turned down a lot trying to get it made.

According to a Tidal press release, over 20 million people attempted to watch the stream at its peak. It's unclear how viewership held up throughout the broadcast, which stretched out over almost two hours. We'll include that information once it's available. 
 
 Representatives for the service also chalked up some early technical issues — people had trouble watching the stream at high bitrates — to AMV and Akamai, the companies responsible for the stream's technical aspects. (AMV is a digital media company, and Akamai is a "content delivery network.") If you're still watching Kanye speak — he's currently unveiling a video game about his mother flying to heaven — know that millions of people (!) are probably doing the same. There aren't many other musicians who could pull this off. ||||| Photo 
 
 Martin Shkreli, the founder and former chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals and a social media lightning rod, has attempted to divert some attention from the Yeezy proceedings by offering on Twitter to buy the recording of “The Life of Pablo” for $10 million. 
 
 In an introduction, Mr. Shkreli described himself as a businessman from New York City “focused on pharmaceuticals.” He asked Mr. West to consider withholding the release of his newest album and selling it to him. 
 
 “I believe you (and your partners) will find this financial arrangement more attractive than your current course of action,” he wrote. 
 
 Here is my initial offer for the album. @kanyewest Thanks for your consideration and I look forward to your response pic.twitter.com/opJ7mlfraK — Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) February 11, 2016 
 
 History suggests that Mr. ShkreliÔÇÖs offer may be sincere: In December, he purchased the only copy of Wu-Tang ClanÔÇÖs latest album, “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin,” for $2 million. 
 
 That purchase has apparently only added to the host of legal problems faced by Mr. Shkreli, who was indicted on charges of a small-time hedge fund fraud in December. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Mr. Shkreli faced a lawsuit from artists who say their work was stolen to illustrate the album. 
 
 Mr. Shkreli, who has appeared to revel in drawing ire from the public, seemed to be trying to outdo Mr. West at creating a public spectacle. 
 
 “Kanye and his label are legally required to take my offer letter to their Board of Directors,” Mr. Shkreli added in another tweet. “This should delay the album by a few days.” ||||| As promised, Kanye West unveiled his new, long-awaited album The Life of Pablo at Madison Square Garden on Thursday. The premiere, which was streamed all over the world and was attended by the likes of Kim Kardashian, Frank Ocean, 50 Cent, and others, also included the debut of his Yeezy Season 3 collection. As expected, T.L.O.P. contains highly memorable lyrics. Here's a sampling from what Kanye declared ONE of the greatest albums of all time.
