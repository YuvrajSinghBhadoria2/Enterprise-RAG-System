 A strong storm front with heavy rain raced through the Houston region today, leaving behind so much water, it's completely shut down Texas 288 at the South Loop. 
 
 Much of the heaviest rainfall occurred before noon as the fast-moving storm pushed east quickly, according to the National Weather Service. Forecasters said as much as 4.5 inches of rainfall was recorded in some areas, especially south and southwest of the metropolitan area. 
 
 A tornado and hail were reported out in the Katy area, plus one wind gust of 60 mph was recorded near Highway 290 and the West Loop. 
 
 An apparent tornado tore portions of roofs off garages and homes as well as toppled wooden fences in a residential area near Bissonnet and Gaines near Sugar Land. One resident of a damaged home, 21-year-old Umair Sayyed, said he hid in a closet with his mother and 4-year-old sister as the storm rumbled through the area. 
 
 Another tornado reportedly touched down near FM 1093 at FM 723, near the Grand Parkway and Mason Road earlier this morning. Nickel-sized hail has been reported at Highway 99 and Fry Road, and bigger hail was seen in Wharton County earlier this morning. 
 
 More than a dozen freeway intersections were flooded this morning. 
 
 People in cars stalled in high water on roadways called 911 for rescue, said Houston Fire Department Assistant Chief Lisa Campbell. Firefighters helped people get out of their cars and take them to safer areas. No injuries were reported. 
 
 Also, HFD had no reports of swift-water rescues. 
 
 Campbell said HFD ambulances and engines had trouble making emergency calls because of the high water and have been rerouted around flooded areas. One engine stalled in high water on Houston near Washington in a low area. 
 
 CenterPoint Energy reported power outages affecting about 19,600 customers earlier today. 
 
 FuelFix.com is reporting that areas inside Loop 610 were hardest hit, particularly between Texas 288 and I-45, according to an outage-tracking map updated by CenterPoint every 15 minutes. 
 
 There was a cluster of outages in South Houston as well. 
 
 A flash flood warning was in effect for Brazoria, Chambers, Galveston, Fort Bend and Harris counties until 2 p.m. 
 
 In Richmond, people were evacuated by boat from areas near downtown, according to the Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office. The Richmond Police Department could not be reached for comment. 
 
 Flooded streets forced Metro to reroute some buses and the Metro Rail service in downtown is limited because of water on the tracks. Light rail service is limited to the Downtown Transit Center and the Preston Station on Main Street. 
 
 The Harris County Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management has upgraded his readiness level in response to the severe weather. 
 
 The Methodist Hospital in the Texas Medical Center activated the first stage of its flood response plan late Monday morning after monitoring bayou levels. Spokeswoman Stephanie Asin said the loading docks and the valet parking station at the neurosensory center have been closed. 
 
 Several parking garages in the Texas Medical Center have been closed because of high water. 
 
 Alexa Enriquez, a spokeswoman for the medical center, said Parking Garage 1, 7 and 15 have been closed. Entrances to those garages were closed when water in the Box Culvert off Braes Bayou reached 10 feet earlier Monday morning; Enriquez said the exits were closed when the water level reached 14 feet. They will reopen when the water recedes, she said. 
 
 The forecast 
 
 After today's storms, the area is expected to dry out quickly and a cold front is expected to hit later this week, dropping temperatures to near freezing. 
 
 At least four inches of rain has been recorded in Livingston since midnight Sunday. 
 
 Monday in the Houston area the heaviest downpours and thunderstorms are expected in the afternoon as the storm moves through the region. Forecasters said some spots could record up to about three inches of rainfall but most areas will receive about one inch. 
 
 The high temperature will top out at 71 under cloudy skies. The overnight low will be about 51. South winds will be between 5 mph and 15 mph. A 100 percent chance of rain is likely. 
 
 The area dries out and cools down slightly Tuesday, when rain chances drop to 20 percent. The high will be about 59 degrees under partly sunny skies. The low will be about 42. West winds will be about 15 mph with gusts up to 20 mph. 
 
 Sunny skies are expected Wednesday as the Norther, packed with Canadian air, approaches the region. The high will be about 67 degrees before the front arrives, but drops to 44 at night as the front moves closer. 
 
 The high will struggle to about 55 degrees Thursday under cloudy skies after the front hits. The overnight low will be about 33 when the cold air settles in the region. Some spots north of Houston near Huntsville and Conroe could see the mercury dip to freezing. 
 
 Friday is likely to be sunny with a high near 54 degrees. The low will be near 39. 
 
 Temperatures climb on the weekend. The high Saturday will be about 59 under mostly sunny skies. The low will be near 45. 
 
 Clouds build above the region Sunday as another storm system approaches the area. The high will be about 63. Forecasters said it to early to determine if the storm will bring rain.

 Chronicle photographer James Nielsen, reporter Jeannie Kever, web producer Laura Weisman, and The Associated Press contributed to this report ||||| Richard Carson / Reuters This vehicle was among the dozens stranded in high water across Houston on Monday. 
 
 Torrential rain, flooding that cut off highways and even suspected tornadoes gave the Houston area major weather headaches on Monday. 
 
 The Mall of the Mainland in Texas City had to close after damage from a suspected twister Monday afternoon. It was unclear if there were any injuries. 
 
 "The structural integrity of the building has been compromised," Texas City Fire Chief Joe Gorman was quoted by the Houston Chronicle as saying. 
 
 Several homes closer to Houston were damaged by another suspected twister. 
 
 "All the doors in the house were trying to open and shut. It sounded like a train going through, so we hid in the closet," Beverly Moore was quoted by KPRC TV as saying. "It was definitely a tornado. We hid for about 15 minutes." 
 
 Nick de la Torre / Houston Chronicle via AP This intersection in Houston, at Buffalo Speedway and Richmond Avenue, saw plenty of heavy rain Monday. 
 
 The deluge from the system closed down a stretch of Texas State Highway 288 for most of the day. A dozen other freeway intersections in the Houston area also saw flooding and rainfall of more than four inches in just a few hours. 
 
 "Between 9 a.m. and about noon today the Houston police department had 51 active flood locations with flooding reports and that’s all over the city in city streets,” the Chronicle quoted city spokesman Michael Walter as saying. 
 
 The suburb of Sugar Land got more than six inches of rain. 
 
 The storm cut power to nearly 20,000 utility customers at its peak, and officials reported numerous water rescues of people stranded in homes or cars. 
 
 Houston, like most of Texas, has seen drought conditions for most of the last year and Monday's storm isn't expect to help much on its own. Any sustained recovery will require a long stretch of rain, forecasters say.
