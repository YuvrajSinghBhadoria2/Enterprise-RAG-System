Abstract Given prior evidence that an affected woman conveys a higher risk of ovarian cancer to her sister than to her mother, we hypothesized that there exists an X-linked variant evidenced by transmission to a woman from her paternal grandmother via her father. We ascertained 3,499 grandmother/granddaughter pairs from the Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute observing 892 informative pairs with 157 affected granddaughters. We performed germline X-chromosome exome sequencing on 186 women with ovarian cancer from the registry. The rate of cancers was 28.4% in paternal grandmother/granddaughter pairs and 13.9% in maternal pairs consistent with an X-linked dominant model (Chi-square test X2 = 0.02, p = 0.89) and inconsistent with an autosomal dominant model (X2 = 20.4, p<0.001). Paternal grandmother cases had an earlier age-of-onset versus maternal cases (hazard ratio HR = 1.59, 95%CI: 1.12–2.25) independent of BRCA1/2 status. Reinforcing the X-linked hypothesis, we observed an association between prostate cancer in men and ovarian cancer in his mother and daughters (odds ratio, OR = 2.34, p = 0.034). Unaffected mothers with affected daughters produced significantly more daughters than sons (ratio = 1.96, p<0.005). We performed exome sequencing in reported BRCA negative cases from the registry. Considering age-of-onset, one missense variant (rs176026 in MAGEC3) reached chromosome-wide significance (Hazard ratio HR = 2.85, 95%CI: 1.75–4.65) advancing the age of onset by 6.7 years. In addition to the well-known contribution of BRCA, we demonstrate that a genetic locus on the X-chromosome contributes to ovarian cancer risk. An X-linked pattern of inheritance has implications for genetic risk stratification. Women with an affected paternal grandmother and sisters of affected women are at increased risk for ovarian cancer. Further work is required to validate this variant and to characterize carrier families. 
 
 Author summary Our article uses the largest familial study of ovarian cancer to argue that there exists an ovarian cancer susceptibility gene on the X-chromosome acting independently of BRCA1 and BRCA2. This observation implies that there may be many cases of seemingly sporadic ovarian cancer that are actually inherited; for example, only daughters who inherit risk from their fathers. This X-linked pattern implies novel ways to prioritize families for screening even without additional testing—sisters must both be carriers or neither; fathers of women with potentially inherited ovarian cancer may receive new attention. In addition, we found evidence that other cancers affect fathers and sons in these families. Using sequencing technology, we isolated a candidate gene, MAGEC3, that may be associated with earlier onset of ovarian cancer. The further study of this gene and the X-linked pattern will require additional study.

 Introduction A history of ovarian cancer among first-order relatives remains the strongest and best-characterized predictor of ovarian cancer risk [1–3] and a main determinant of genetic testing referral [4, 5]. The evidence for a monogenic, autosomal dominant mode of inherited risk dates to the pre-BRCA era where studies focused on assessing heritability [6,7] using affected first-order and second-order [8] female relatives. In a systematic review, Stratton and colleagues noted that, “not explicable in terms of any genetic model,” an affected woman’s sisters are at higher risk of disease than their mother [1]. We propose an explanation to this paradox is the existence of an X-linked gene that must pass preferentially from a carrier father to each of his daughters. Genetic evidence of X-linkage has appeared in cytogenetic studies where loss of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) can be visualized by loss of heterochromatin based Barr bodies [9]. Studies of ovarian tumors’ genomic profiles show loss of heterozygosity around Xq25 and Xp [10,11] as well as patterns of XCI [12,13] possibly associated with tumors of low malignant potential [14]. Studies investigating a mechanistic connection between BRCA1 and XCI [15,16], especially in tissue after transformation [17], are mixed but tend to conclude that XCI dysregulation is BRCA independent [9,18,19]. The Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry housed at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (Buffalo, NY), for over 35 years comprises over 50,000 participants and 5,600 cancers in 2,600 families. To leverage the deep pedigree data in this study, we reasoned that, if the disease allele passes through the father’s side of the family, it could be inferred by disease in a woman’s father’s mother. That is, by considering the frequency of disease transmission in grandmother/granddaughter pairs with an intermediate son/father. Under an autosomal dominant model, an affected grandmother (either maternal or paternal) passes the disease allele to her granddaughter with probability 1/4. This means that data previously presented by affected mothers and sisters are not able to discriminate between autosomal and X-linked models and these effects have been previously indistinguishable by segregation analysis due to disease censoring in fathers. In the X-linked dominant model, while a maternal grandmother again passes the disease allele to her granddaughter with probability 1/4, a paternal grandmother passes the allele to her granddaughter with probability 1/2 due to deterministic transmission by the obligate carrier son/father. Therefore, we might discriminate between autosomal versus X-linked models by considering the rate of cancers in granddaughters with exactly one affected grandmother. An autosomal dominant model predicts an equal rate of cancers in maternal-lineage and paternal-lineage pairs while an X-linked dominant model predicts that paternal-lineage families will have twice the rate of cancers (Fig 1).

Two family patterns with a pair of first-degree affected women are the maternal grandmother (MGM) family and the paternal grandmother (PGM) family. Stratton’s paradox implies that PGM families are more likely under X-linkage because a father must pass the variant to all of his daughters. The rates are equal if the variant is autosomal. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007194.g001 We collected almost 3,500 grandmother/granddaughter pairs within the registry to test this paternal lineage hypothesis and were able to sequence 159 germlines to search for candidate variants. 
 
 Discussion We have presented evidence that there may exist an X-linked model of transmission of an ovarian cancer susceptibility gene. Our observations are supported by a large familial study and the novel use of grandmother/granddaughter pairs to observe an increased rate of cancer among paternal granddaughters, an earlier age of onset, and a bias towards families with more daughters. We sequenced the X chromosomes of a small number of registry members in order to isolate a candidate gene, but we cannot rule out the possibility that our reported variant is in linkage with the true variant. However, the segregation analysis and age of onset analyses do suggest that it is likely to lie on the X chromosome. Future studies are warranted to confirm the identity and function of the X-linked gene that contributes to familial transmission of ovarian cancer. Limitations of our study include the case-only design, which has required us to forgo investigating common variants. While the number of pedigrees in the registry is large, unrelated case-control studies are much larger and would likely yield other potential variants. Our study population is nearly exclusively Caucasian and our results may not extend to other populations. Our exome sequencing approach focuses on the coding regions of the X-chromosome only. This design is unable to identify intragenic variants and complex rearrangements not involving exons. Evidence of X-linkage is not inconsistent with the prevailing autosomal dominant BRCA1/2 with polygenic weak variant effects model for ovarian cancer [8]. Ramus and colleagues [21] previously noted a lack of BRCA mutations in more than 33% of families with 3 or more ovarian cancers and 35% of families with breast/ovary cancers and concluded that there is a missing susceptibility gene. In families with two cases of ovarian cancer, the rate of BRCA mutations increased from 27% with no breast cancers to 83% with two breast cancer cases suggesting that BRCA mutations may be more specific to breast cancers. Schildkraut and colleagues [25] inferred that there must exist both shared and disease-specific genes after estimating the heritable correlation between breast and ovary cancers at h2 = 0.48. The missing gene might be ovarian cancer specific. We suspect that the difficulty identifying this missing heritability may be due, in part, to historically inconsistent disease definition. In our literature review, we noted that studies that ascertained patients for breast cancer first and then acquired family members with ovarian cancer only saw increased risk to mothers [26]. Indeed, aggregated breast/ovary cancer studies [27] tend to show the autosomal dominant model while studies that carefully isolate ovary cancers uncover the X-linked, sister/mother effect [1]: given a family history of breast cancer, a mother with breast cancer increases the ovarian cancer risk to her daughter (OR = 2.3) while an affected sister yields a negligible odds ratio (OR = 1.1). Conversely in families with a history of ovarian cancer only, a mother’s ovarian cancer raised her daughters’ ovarian cancer risk (OR = 2.3, but p>0.05) while a sister’s ovarian cancer nearly quadruples her sister’s risk (OR = 3.92) [28]. Therefore, the autosomal dominant genes may be common to both breast and ovary cancers while the X-linked gene may be ovary-specific. We emphasize that future studies should be carefully designed to isolate X-linked versus autosomal and ovary-specific versus breast-ovary associations and to distinguish sporadic and hereditary ovarian cancers. Identifying a significant X-linked contribution to familial ovarian cancer risk has implications for clinical genetics: with suspicion of paternal lineage, an affected woman’s sisters are at significantly increased risk for ovarian cancer and ought to be counseled. If the affected woman carries the X-linked gene through her father, her sisters must also be carriers. It is reasonable to conjecture that maternal-lineage bias may have affected how patients, physicians, and researchers view family history and so the X-linked pattern may imply a familial origin for ovarian cancers previously thought to be sporadic cases. In particular, if the disease transmits through the father’s side, cases manifesting in only children or a woman with only brothers may not appear overtly hereditary. Using the rate of second generation grandmother pairs, we observed twice as many affected maternal grandmothers versus paternal. Without ascertainment bias, we would have expected a balanced rate, so we might predict that, other things equal, we have missed almost two paternal cases for every observed one. We have provided some evidence that MAGEC3 is a potential candidate for the X-linked gene near previous linkage loci and it possesses a missense variant with large effect, rare prevalence and is associated with earlier onset. While MAGEC3 is thought to be a cancer testis antigen, it shows some expression in normal heart, brain, fallopian tube and pituitary gland tissues suggesting that the loss of expression of MAGEC3 plays some role in cancer formation. We have previously shown that co-expression patterns of the MAGE genes are non-random in ovarian tumors [29] and that other X-linked CT antigens (NY-ESO-1 encoded by CTAG1B) signaling highly aggressive tumors [30]. The only MHD-carrying yeast homologous gene (NSE3) binds with NSE1 and complexes with SMC5/SMC6 to repair double strand breaks via homologous recombination [31–33]. On the other hand, family members MAGEA [34, 35], MAGEC2 [36], carrying a paralogous MHD, have been shown to bind to RING domain proteins to form a p53 interacting E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes tumorigenesis. Recently, computational modeling of sex-bias in cancers affecting both sexes has identified MAGEC3 directly as a putative X-linked tumor suppressor [37]. Reinforcing our observation that men in X-linked families may be at increased risk of prostate cancer, the cytoband housing MAGEC3 (Xq27.2) has been previously linked to these hereditary cancers [38], raising the possibility that there is a common hereditary X-linked locus responsible for reproductive tract-specific cancers. While not unexpected for the X-chromosome [39], the candidate SNP appeared to rest in HWE while the HapMap populations reject HWE for this SNP. Given that the population frequencies are correlated with ovarian cancer incidence, we conjecture that the general population is under selection against the G allele (and against ovarian cancer) and it is the registry population that inherits neutrally and therefore more often manifests disease. This conjecture is consistent with the observations that CT antigens, especially those on the X chromosome, are under strong positive selection [40] and that the region containing MAGEC3 shows strong inter-population difference [41]. While the latter study localized the effect to MAGEC2 and not MAGEC3, their criterion for the frequency difference was aggressively high (delta > 0.90) which would preclude the SNPs that may be still be in the middle of a soft selective sweep. That the beneficial A allele in rs176026 has not yet fixed may explain why we have found a common variant, but it may also imply that the true cancer phenotype variant is hitchhiking along with the selective pressure behind the CT antigens. 
 
 Methods Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry Families in the Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry (formerly Gilda Radner Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry, Buffalo, NY) have been accessioned continuously from 1981 to present as described previously [8,42]. Briefly, qualifying families must have (a) two or more cases of ovarian cancer, (b) one ovarian cancer with two or more other cancers or (c) an early onset (age 45) ovarian cancer and at least one other cancer. Families provide written informed consent under Roswell Park Cancer Institute protocol CIC95-27. Cases are verified by medical record and/or death certificate when required and stage and histology are verified by a registry pathologist. The registry comprises 50,401 individuals including 5,614 ovarian cancers from 2,636 unique families. Families are also classified by disease pattern: families manifesting only ovarian cancer are termed “site-specific ovary” families and families with a number of breast cancers as well as ovarian cancers are “breast and ovary” families. First and second order pair ascertainment Considering women who (a) were at least 45 without disease at last contact or (b) had died without disease and those with confirmed ovarian cancer, we observed over 8,900 mother-daughter pairs and 27,000 sister-sister pairs. From large registry pedigrees, we ascertained 3,499 women with two grandmothers who possessed a recorded disease status. Of these granddaughters, 2,569 reported no affected grandmothers (73.4%), 892 had exactly one affected grandmother (25.5%) and 38 had two affected grandmothers (1.1%). These women came from large pedigrees where the average family under study has 27.3 individuals (range: 8–330). Of the 3,499 pairs, 619 belonged to high-risk families tested for BRCA mutations as previously described [8]. Families are classified as BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 positive if any one family member tests positive for a deleterious mutation. If every family member tests negative, the family is classified as BRCA negative. X-chromosome sequencing Due to the age of the study cohort and availability of blood samples, we could not sequence all of the grandmother/granddaughter pairs. We focused on 159 women who reported a negative BRCA test and had an available DNA sample. DNA samples were whole-exome sequenced using Agilent SureSelect Human All Exome 50Mb kits v3 and v5. Raw sequence reads were aligned to the Human Reference Genome (NCBI Build 37) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) [43], Picard [44] and GATK [45]. We retained variants within the X-chromosome exome with at least a 10% rate of non-reference genotypes, using the total, 2,161, to set the chromosome-wide significance threshold for the log-rank test of age-of-onset association at–log 10 (0.05/2161) = 4.636 on the log odds (LOD) scale. BRCA status was re-evaluated based on the sequencing results. Population genetics Ovarian cancer incidence data was downloaded from the IARC website [46]. HapMap allele frequencies were accessed via dbSNP and 1000 genomes populations via the Phase 3 1000 genomes browser. Correlations between the incidence and allele frequency were assessed by simple linear regression. The sequenced women all self-report Caucasian ancestry which we confirmed through principal components analysis. Within sib-ship likelihood models Assume that we observe W = W n + W c women with ovarian cancer among a sistership of N = N n + N c women, where the subscripts n and c refer to non-carriers and variant carriers. The likelihood of W given the probability of disease in carriers (p c ) and non-carriers (p n ) can be constructed by assuming that, conditional on N n and N c , W n and W c are simply binomial random variables. Under an autosomal model, Nc is Binomial (N, 0.5). Under the X-linked model, P(N c = N) = P(N c = 0). Evaluating these likelihoods by enumerating admissible combinations of (W n , W c , N n , N c ) is straightforward. Tissue expression data We downloaded GTEx v7 data (https://www.gtexportal.org/) aligning reported female cases only with known tissue sample types. We normalized the MAGEC3 RNAseq levels to MAGEA1 levels on a per sample basis. TCGA ovary data on the quantile normalized HuEx array were downloaded from the GDAC Firehose (https://gdac.broadinstitute.org/) and cBioPortal’s normalized RNAseq Z-scores. Functional analysis We examined SNP-based linkage via LDLink, LDproxy [47] using the CEU population for reference. The functional predictions for missense SNPs were scored by PolyPhen [22] and the regulation was scored by HaploReg (v4) [48] using the EUR reference and its default position weight-matrix scoring algorithms [49]. Statistical analysis Expected frequencies under the autosomal model were based on the pooled case frequency (157/892 = 17.6%). It can be shown that the X-linked likelihood was maximized by a granddaughter cancer rate of 14.0%. Goodness-of-fit was tested versus a chi-square distribution. Pedigree likelihoods were evaluated using the kinship2 [20] algorithms. Relative risk and odds ratio confidence intervals were computed under the log transform. Age-of-onset was defined as the shortest time to death, ovarian cancer diagnosis or prophylactic oophorectomy censored by age at last contact. The majority of granddaughter ages were observed (89.0%, 3080/3461). Risk of disease was estimated using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) estimate, tested with the log-rank test and hazard ratios estimated through Cox’s partial likelihood with graphical diagnostics for proportional hazards. All tests are two-sided and analyses were performed in R3.3.1 including the survival package.

 US scientists believe they have identified a new gene mutation that can raise the risk of ovarian cancer, and is passed from father to daughter. 
 
 It is inherited through the X-chromosome and is independent of other known susceptibility genes that women can already be tested for. 
 
 Experts say more studies are needed to confirm the identity and function of the gene. 
 
 The latest findings appear in the journal PLoS Genetics. 
 
 Family risk 
 
 Currently, women with a strong family history of cancer can be tested for the BRCA gene, which greatly increases a woman's chance of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer. 
 
 Angelina Jolie inherited BRCA1 from her mother - she had preventative surgery after her doctors estimated she had an 87% risk of breast cancer and a 50% risk of ovarian cancer. 
 
 But researchers believe there may be many other cases of seemingly sporadic ovarian cancer that are actually inherited - some via the X chromosome girls get from their father.

 Men pass on one X chromosome to their daughters. 
 
 Dr Kevin Eng and colleagues at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute honed in on one suspect gene, called MAGEC3, located on the X chromosome from fathers. 
 
 Ovarian cancers linked to genes inherited from the father (and paternal grandmother) had an earlier age-of-onset than ones linked to maternal genes, and were also associated with higher rates of prostate cancer in fathers and sons. 
 
 Lead author Kevin Eng from the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Centre in Buffalo, New York said: "What we have to do next is make sure we have the right gene by sequencing more families. This finding has sparked a lot of discussion within our group about how to find these X-linked families. 
 
 "It's an all-or-none kind of pattern: A family with three daughters who all have ovarian cancer is more likely to be driven by inherited X mutations than by BRCA mutations." 
 
 Ovarian cancer and BRCA 
 
 Most women in the UK have a one in 54 chance of developing ovarian cancer in their lifetime, 
 
 BRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes that help repair damage to the DNA in our cells. If people inherit a mutated version of either of these genes it puts them at greater risk of certain cancers. 
 
 BRCA 1 mutation gives women a lifetime risk of ovarian cancer of 40-50%. 
 
 If women know they have BRCA gene mutations, they can choose to take action before cancer develops. 
 
 Angelina Jolie had her fallopian tubes and ovaries removed when she found she had BRCA1 
 
 Dr Catherine Pickworth from Cancer Research UK said: "This research suggests that some women's risk of ovarian cancer could be passed down through their father's family, as well as their mother's, due to newly discovered faulty genes. 
 
 "In future, this could help women with a family history of ovarian cancer better understand their risk of developing the disease. This is important because ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at a late stage when it's harder to treat. Further work is now needed to get a clearer picture of how the genetic faults uncovered in this research might affect inherited risk of ovarian cancer." 
 
 Annwen Jones, Chief Executive of Target Ovarian Cancer, said: "These findings, if borne out by further research, would represent a significant step forward in ovarian cancer prevention, saving thousands of lives". ||||| Does your baldness gene come from your mother or father? 
 
 There are a lot of myths and misinformation about the genetic causes of male pattern baldness (MPB). One of the most enduring is that a man inherits the genetic propensity for MPB from his mother. While there is some truth to this, it is not the whole story. 
 
 The primary baldness gene is on the X, or female chromosome, which men do inherit from their mothers. A study from the University of Bonn in Germany from 2005 confirmed this, and added fuel to the mother myth. And it is true: the hereditary factor is more dominant on the mother’s side. If your dad has a full head of hair but your mom’s brother is a 5 on the Norwood Scale at age 35, chances are you will follow your uncle’s journey through MPB. 
 
 However, the gene for MPB is actually passed down from both sides of the family. Furthermore baldness genes may skip generations, and skip people within the same generation. This is why it is perfectly possible to have an older brother with enviable full, thick hair, while you are stuck with a Norwood 3 at age 27. 
 
 The result means that there are millions of families where the older brother gets the George Clooney hair while the younger is stuck with the Vin Diesel look, or visa versa. Furthermore, if you take four brothers it is absolutely possible to have a Norwood 3, 5 and 7 and a fourth brother with no MPB at all within that same family. 
 
 If most of the men on your mother’s AND your father’s side are bald, then you, your sons and brothers all have an increased propensity to experience MPB. 
 
 Life just isn’t fair sometimes. Luckily we live in an era when you don’t have sit by and simply watch your hair thin away to nothing. There are many FDA-approved medical advances that help you keep the hair you have, and even if you think you are too far gone, chances are you may be a candidate for a hair transplant. 
 
 If you are considering a transplant choose your physician carefully. Research the physician and clinic, consider their reputation, training, experience, accreditations and patient comments. Expect to meet and talk with the physician—the one who will actually do your procedure—at the consultation. And, check out real hair transplant before and after photos on actual patients of the clinic.

 A study of about 10,000 families impacted by ovarian cancer found a genetic mutation passed down through the father's X chromosome is entirely separate from the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutaions which are passed on by both mother and father. 
 
 This mutation was also found to be associated with higher rates of prostate cancer in fathers and sons. 
 
 Published in journal PLOS, the researchers said the findings of the 30-year study could explain why some families have multiple members affected by the disease. 
 
 "A family with three daughters who all have ovarian cancer is more likely to be driven by inherited X mutations than by BRCA mutations," said Kevin Eng, a professor of oncology at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, New York. 
 
 Using the Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry, researchers looked at data collected over 30 years and collected information about pairs of granddaughters and grandmothers. They then sequenced portions of the X-chromosome from 186 women affected by the cancer. 
 
 Women born to fathers whose mother had been affected by ovarian cancer were twice as likely to develop the disease, compared to those who inherited the disease from their mother's side, data showed. 
 
 "The paternal-lineage women had 2.04 times the risk of maternal-lineage women," the authors wrote. 
 
 Women carrying this previously unknown mutation on the X-chromosome also developed the cancer more than six years earlier than average. 
 
 "We observed a significant acceleration in the development of disease in granddaughters with an affected paternal grandmother versus maternal grandmother," wrote the authors. 
 
 Professor Georgia Chenevix-Trench of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said it had always been known ovarian cancer could be inherited through the father. 
 
 What the new research does suggest is that there might be something specifically on the X chromosome that adds to that risk, the Australian geneticist said. 
 
 However she added more research is needed, noting a previous and much larger study failed to show any association between the specific mutation variation the authors refer to and disease. 
 
 "What's interesting about this paper, if it's correct, is that there seems to be something extra on the X chromosome that the paternal grandmother will pass on to her son and that will always be passed on to his daughters," Professor Chenevix-Trench told AAP. 
 
 "It doesn't all of a sudden mean most of a woman's risk of ovarian cancer is inherited through the father," she said. 
 
 "It just means there might be a little bit of additional risk through your father." ||||| Fathers may be partially responsible for passing on to their daughters genetic risk factors for ovarian cancer, a new study published Thursday in PLoS Genetics has shown. By looking at the patterns of cancer within families, researchers found that women had a higher risk of ovarian cancer if their paternal grandmothers were afflicted by the disease. 
 
 Women with a mutation on a particular gene found on the X chromosome, called MAGEC3, appeared to get ovarian cancer 6.7 years earlier than they would have without the mutation. Among the families involved in the study, the average age that women with the mutation got ovarian cancer was 44. 
 
 Women carry two X chromosomes in their cells—one from their mother, the other from their father. “The gene does exist on mom’s chromosomes too,” Kevin Eng, a researcher at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute who was one of the authors of the paper, told Newsweek. But because a woman’s father has only one X chromosome to give to his daughters, a father with mutations in this gene is guaranteed to pass it on. 
 
 “If you do inherit it from dad, the pattern is really all or nothing,” Eng said. “That means you and every one of your sisters is going to carry the mutation.” 
 
 Eng and his colleagues used data from an ovarian cancer registry for people with at least two cases of the disease in their families. “Physicians at Roswell Park have been running this registry for quite a long time,” Eng said—about 35 years. The registry includes about 2,700 families. 
 
 There are other, more famous mutations on genes linked with ovarian cancer risk: BRCA1 and BRCA2. According to the American Cancer Society, women who carry a BRCA1 mutation have up to a 70 percent chance of getting ovarian cancer at some point. Genetic tests exist for BRCA1 and BRCA2, and in theory testing could be done for MAGEC3. But more research would need to be done before that happens. 
 
 Less than 10 percent of ovarian cancers may be due to genetic mutations, the American Cancer Society noted. Ovarian cancer is responsible for less than 2 percent of new cancer diagnoses in the United States each year. Almost half of people with ovarian cancer are still alive five years after they are diagnosed.
