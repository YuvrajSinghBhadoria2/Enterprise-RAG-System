 Hi there, 
 
 Having been recently alerted to the Victoria Liss story on your website [here and here], I cannot stand by and have my good name tarnished. 
 
 As an Andrew Meyer who lives nowhere near the scene of the crime (I live in Fountain Valley, California), I am outraged by this situation. 
 
 I would like to cover for the trouble that poor Victoria has had to go through on behalf of someone who should be ashamed of himself on so many levels. 
 
 As a result, I'd like to send a 100% tip from the cost of the meal to Victoria. I will send $28.98 to her if you can arrange for that to happen. 
 
 Please contact me via e-mail or at [redacted]. 
 
 My "name" can't be shamed anymore. It was bad enough when this guy tried his part. 
 
 I can stand my ground no more. 
 
 Looking forward to hearing from you. 
 
 Andrew Meyer ||||| Bad tippers be warned, there are servers out there in restaurants who may hunt you down if you don't deliver what they deem an appropriate tip. Servers like Victoria Liss, who has waged an all-out manhunt/smear campaign to make "yuppie scum" Andrew Meyers pay for what he left her. 
 
 
 
 Meyers moseyed into Bimbo's Cantina in Seattle last Friday night with a lady friend where Liss had the "pleasure" of waiting on them. They had some chips, guac, a double-decker pork taco, and no apparent complaints. When the bill for $28.98 came, it was bad enough that Meyers put a big old zero on the tip line, but it's what he wrote at the bottom of the bill that really pissed Liss off: "P.S. You could stand to loose [sic] a few pounds." 
 
 Oh, yes he did ... and in doing so raised the ire of Liss and subsequently mobs of Internet users after Liss set out to pay him back via public shaming.
