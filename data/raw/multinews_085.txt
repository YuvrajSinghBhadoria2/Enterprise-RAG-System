 In a statement Barr acknowledged as her own, she said: "I deeply regret my comments from late last night on Twitter. Above all, I want to apologize to Valerie Jarrett, as well as to ABC and the cast and crew of the Roseanne show. I am sorry for making a thoughtless joke that does not reflect my values - I love all people and am very sorry. Today my words caused hundreds of hardworking people to lose their jobs. I also sincerely apologize to the audience that has embraced my work for decades. I apologize from the bottom of my heart and hope you can find it in your hearts to forgive me." 
 
 The comedian then retweeted messages from supporters who defend the tweet that got her show canceled. 
 
 Barr tweeted: "hey guys, don't defend me, it's sweet of you 2 try, but...losing my show is 0 compared 2 being labelled a racist over one tweet-that I regret even more." 
 
 But that sentiment contrasted with many retweets from the comedian. Her Twitter timeline shows that, before and after asking fans not to defend her, she retweeted messages suggesting Barr's critics are hypocritical or otherwise defending her original, racist remarks. 
 
 Barr also retweeted a post from a user who said her "apology is not sincere." ||||| Ms. Barr also retweeted a user who asserted that Black Lives Matter and anti-fascist activists are Soros-sponsored front groups. The user referred to Mr. Soros as the “terrorist in chief.” 
 
 The assertions about Mr. Soros that appeared throughout Ms. Barr’s timeline are baseless. Even the conservative National Review, while critical of Mr. Soros, has called the Nazi smear a “slander.” 
 
 In a statement in response to her tweet, a spokesman for Mr. Soros called her claims insulting. 
 
 “George Soros survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary as a 13 year old child by going into hiding and assuming a false identity with the help of his father, who managed to save his own family and help many other Jews survive Holocaust,” the statement read. 
 
 It continued, “He did not collaborate with the Nazis. He did not help round up people. He did not confiscate anybody’s property. Such false allegations are insulting to the victims of the Holocaust, to all Jewish people, and to anyone who honors the truth. They are an affront to Mr. Soros and his family, who against the odds managed to survive one of the darkest moments in our history.” ||||| “It was 2 in the morning and I was ambien tweeting, I made a mistake I wish I hadn’t but…don’t defend it please.” 
 
 Following a racist Twitter rant that cost Roseanne Barr her show on ABC, the television star apologized and bid farewell to the social media platform. Then, she returned and blamed the sleep aid Ambien in a tweet that was later deleted. 
 
 On Tuesday morning, Barr tweeted: “I apologize. I am now leaving Twitter.” 
 
 I apologize. I am now leaving Twitter. — Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) May 29, 2018 
 
 For a while, all was quiet. 
 
 But Barr did not leave Twitter. 
 
 Instead, she launched a tweetstorm late Tuesday evening, first with apologetic tweets, some of which were also deleted. 
 
 “I just want to apologize to the hundreds of people, and wonderful writers (all liberal) and talented actors who lost their jobs on my show due to my stupid tweet,” she wrote. 
 
 In one of her few remaining tweets, Barr asked her followers not to defend her, saying, “it’s sweet of you 2 try, but…losing my show is 0 compared 2 being labelled a racist over one tweet-that I regret even more.”

 And then she opened fire with a volley of defensive retweets that appeared designed to make her look like a victim of “double standards,” as one user said, punished because she supports President Trump and conservative views, “the sacrificial conservative celebrity.” 
 
 I look like a monkey. Why? My DNA is 96% similar to a monkey's. It makes scientific sense. But due to emotions, double standards & feelings science is cancelled this year. There are 5,000 genders & if you don't agree with me you're a racist xenophobe. — An0maly (@LegendaryEnergy) May 30, 2018 
 
 Her retweets, among other things, called out Disney, the parent company of ABC, for tolerating an anti-Trump screed by Keith Olbermann, who recently returned to ESPN, also owned by Disney. Some retweeted posts also criticized ABC’s lack of response to comedian Jimmy Kimmel’s mocking of Melania Trump’s accent as well as “The View’s” Joy Behar calling Vice President Pence mentally ill because of his faith. Kimmel and Behar later apologized. 
 
 Even Harvey Weinstein was treated better by Disney than Barr, suggested one of her retweets. 
 
 Many of the retweeted posts were also later removed from Barr’s Twitter feed.

 This Rosanne thing was always a proxy for Pres Trump. They brought the show back so they could inevitably cancel the show when she said something they didn’t like. They can’t beat Trump so this is a symbolic show of force. Rosanne was always going to end this way. — 🇺🇸 A Free Black Man. 🇺🇸 (@AFreeBlackMan) May 29, 2018 
 
 And finally, early Wednesday morning, Barr tweeted: 
 
 “I’m sorry 4 my tweet, AND I will also defend myself as well as talk to my followers. so, go away if u don’t like it. I will handle my sadness the way I want to. I’m tired of being attacked & belittled more than other comedians who have said worse.” 
 
 She later deleted that tweet, as well. 
 
 Meanwhile, the “Ambien tweet” had caused its own ruckus, despite its deletion. 
 
 I hope ambien has to issue a statement saying they don’t make people racist — Dana Schwartz (@DanaSchwartzzz) May 30, 2018
