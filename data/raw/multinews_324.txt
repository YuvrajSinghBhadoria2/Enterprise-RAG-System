At least 18 Florida lawmakers plan to live on a minimum wage this week to draw attention to efforts to increase the state's minimum wage to $15 an hour. 
 
 Starting Monday, the lawmakers will live for five days on $17 per day. 
 
 That figure represents what a minimum wage worker has after the costs of taxes, childcare and housing are deducted from an $8.05-an-hour paycheck. 
 
 The lawmakers — mostly Democrats — will also go grocery shopping with a minimum wage worker at the start of the week. 
 
 State Sen. Dwight Bullard and state Rep. Victor Torres are pushing legislation to increase Florida's current minimum wage from $8.05 to $15 an hour. ||||| - Two Florida lawmakers are pushing to raise the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour. Sen. Dwight Bullard and Rep. Victor Torres, both Democrats, have both filed bills SB6 and HB109, respectively, to raise Florida’s minimum wage from $8.05 to $15 an hour. 
 
 Sen. Bullard will soon announce he is taking the Minimum Wage Challenge and will live on the same pay as those living on minimum wage for five days. "I'd like my colleagues to see that supporting this bill to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour is the right thing to do for Florida's working families who struggle every day just to make ends meet," said Bullard. 
 
 The filing of similar bills is a trend across the country. Cities such as Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles have all passed $15 an hour. Even New York City’s fast-food workers are expected to receive a higher wage as well.
