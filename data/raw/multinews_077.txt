The Northrop Grumman Remotec Andros™ fleet of hazardous duty unmanned vehicles is the preferred choice of first responders worldwide. The robust, mission-proven design of the Andros line keeps danger at a distance with: 
 
 Simultaneous tool mounts for rapid response during dynamic missions (i.e. suits changing needs as the mission unfolds) 
 
 A versatile array of two-way audio, video, advanced sensors, tools and controllers 
 
 Easy maintainability for minimal downtime 
 
 Made in the USA and backed by world-class training and post-sale support, it’s no wonder there are over 1,000 Andros robots deployed around the globe. ||||| The Dutch police plan to eventually replace their drug- and bomb sniffing dogs with drug- and bomb sniffing robots. The E-Nose is a so-called nano-sensor that can detect chemical and explosive substances, AD reports. 
 
 According to the newspaper, a study by the University of Twente commissioned by the Ministry of Security and Justice shows that the police have major problems with detecting synthetic drugs and drug laboratories. The police make use of sniffer dogs on a daily basis, but training these dogs is an expensive and time consuming operation. 
 
 The police are in need of a "portable detection device" for these cases. And the E-Nose is the solution, according to the study. 
 
 The development of the E-Nose is still in its infancy and the device does not actually exist for use yet. So it will be at least 10 more years before the police can retire their sniffer dogs, according to the newspaper. ||||| Officials said the use of the robot to disarm a violent suspect was unprecedented for the Sheriff's Department, and comes as law enforcement agencies increasingly rely on military-grade technology to reduce the risk of injury during confrontations with civilians.
