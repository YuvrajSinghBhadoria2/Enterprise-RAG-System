I was going to buy a frosty from Wendys until I saw the employee do this ||||| By of the 
 
 Wendy's is investigating the case of an employee who was captured eating soft serve ice cream straight from the machine in a viral photo Wednesday. 
 
 A photo of the worker was posted on Reddit Wednesday morning with the title, "I was going to buy a frosty from Wendys until I saw the employee do this." 
 
 Bob Bertini, a spokesman for Wendy's, responded late Wednesday that he just saw the photo. 
 
 "If true, this is totally inexcusable. We are investigating and will take action," Bertini wrote in an email to the Journal Sentinel. 
 
 A commenter on Reddit pointed out that the photo appears to have been taken behind the counter. The person said the photographer was a fellow employee. 
 
 The Wendy's worker is the most recent fast food worker to gross out potential customers in a viral photo. 
 
 The photos may be posted as a harmless joke (or, who knows, in an attempt to get someone fired maybe?), but viral photos have caused a lot of bad publicity and harm to the companies they target, so businesses tend to crack down hard on the culprit. 
 
 The last fast food worker who pulled a similar viral stunt, a Taco Bell employee who licked a stack of taco shells, was fired. That's even though the shells were destined for the trash bin, according to company spokespeople.
