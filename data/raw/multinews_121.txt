Researchers in Canada have witnessed a horrifying event that, until now, has never been documented by science: A killer whale drowning and killing an infant of the same species. 
 
 The incident took place on December 2, 2016 off the coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Now the sighting has been described in a paper published in the journal Scientific Reports. 
 
 The marine scientists were out on a research expedition when they detected strange calls on their vessel’s underwater microphones, alerting them to the presence of killer whales in their vicinity. 
 
 After finding the whales responsible for the noises, the researchers noticed some splashing that they thought might be a sign that the orcas were hunting. However, they quickly realized that an infant calf in the group wasn’t surfacing. 
 
 "Then a male, who was unrelated to the mother of the calf, swam past the boat with the calf hanging out of its mouth, and that's when we were really quite horrified and fascinated,” Jared Towers, a cetacean researcher from Fisheries and Oceans Canada, told CBC News. 
 
 The stricken calf’s mother and her relatives then frantically pursued the 32-year-old male in an attempt to rescue the youngster, but the male—with help from his own mother—managed to fend them off. 
 
 The researchers describe how the chase eventually ended with the mother of the infant hitting the male so hard with her flipper that blood flew through the air, although by this point, the calf was already dead. 
 
 This is the first time that a killer whale has been observed killing a calf of the same species, according to the study, although infanticide has been observed among many animals before. 
 
 “Among terrestrial mammals, it is mostly reported in primates, carnivores and rodents,” the researchers wrote in the study. “However, compelling evidence for infanticide in cetaceans [a group of animals containing whales, dolphins and porpoises] exists in just three species of dolphin.” 
 
 Towers said the scene was distressing, however, the research team decided to watch until the end in the knowledge that they were witnessing a rare event. 
 
 Because the offending male and his mother did not eat the dead infant, the scientists suggest that the killing may be an example of so-called “sexually selected behavior”—which means that the male killed the calf to mate with its mother. 
 
 "In other mammals, we know that in a lot of cases males kill infants, because it forces the infant's mom into a fertile state much quicker," Towers said. 
 
 What is interesting in this case is that the mother of the male became involved in the killing. 
 
 "Killer whale moms are notorious for helping their adult sons and daughters by sharing food with them and leading them, and maybe even providing mating opportunities for adult male offspring," Towers added. 
 
 The researchers say the recent findings cast doubt on some long-held assumptions regarding the sexual behavior of orcas. Scientists have generally thought that female orcas have free reign when it come to choosing their mates because they are often found at the top of the pod hierarchy. 
 
 But in light of the recent encounter, Towers suggests that the females may not have as much choice as previously believed. ||||| Marine scientists in B.C. have for the first time seen a killer whale drown a baby of the same species. 
 
 The researchers watched the orca infanticide as it unfolded off the northeastern coast of Vancouver Island on Dec. 2, 2016, and published their findings in the journal Scientific Reports this week. 
 
 Cetacean ecologist Jared Towers remembers heading out on the water with two colleagues after underwater microphones picked up some transient killer whale calls that seemed a bit strange. 
 
 The researchers tracked down the whales, identified and photographed them and were about to leave when they noticed some splashing — it looked like the orcas might have found some prey. 
 
 "That's when we realized that the calf — it was a brand-new calf in the group — it wasn't surfacing at all," Towers told CBC News. 
 
 "Then the male, who was unrelated to the mother of the calf, swam past the boat with the calf hanging out of its mouth, and that's when we were really quite horrified and fascinated."

 Infanticide isn't unheard of among mammals. Lions do it. Primates do it. Even some bears do it, but it hadn't been documented in killer whales before. 
 
 Towers described the distressing scene as something that he'll never unsee, but the researchers quickly realized the significance of the event and stuck around to watch the aftermath. 
 
 Over the next few minutes, they observed as the calf's mother and her relatives chased the male around, while the male's mother tried to fend them off. There was more splashing, and a hydrophone below the water captured the frantic calls of the whales. 
 
 "That all kind of came to a grinding halt when the mother of the infant hit the male so hard that … his blubber was shaking on his body and you could see blood flying through the air. That was kind of the final impact, but he never let go of the infant," Towers recalled.

 Despite the fact that transient killer whales feed on other mammals, including seals, seal lions and young cetaceans from other species, the adult male and his mother did not feed on the baby orca. 
 
 That led the scientists to suspect this was an example of what's called sexually selected behaviour. In other words, they believe the 32-year-old male killed the calf so that he could mate with its mother. 
 
 "In other mammals, we know that in a lot of cases males kill infants, because it forces the infant's mom into a fertile state much quicker," Towers said.

 And in a twist unique to orcas, the male's mother got involved. 
 
 "Killer whale moms are notorious for helping their adult sons and daughters by sharing food with them and leading them, and maybe even providing mating opportunities for adult male offspring," Towers explained. 
 
 The encounter brings into question some previous assumptions about the sexual behaviour of killer whales. Because female orcas are the leaders of their pods, researchers have often guessed that they could be choosy about their mates. 
 
 "Looking at the behaviour we've observed, we're now beginning to think that it's quite possible that females don't have a lot of choice when it comes to breeding," Towers said. 
 
 But he added that the infanticide proves that even after 40 years of observing orcas in the wild off the B.C. coast, there are still huge gaps in our knowledge about these marine mammals. ||||| (SEATTLE) — With the number of endangered orcas that frequent the inland waters of Washington state at a 30-year low, Gov. Jay Inslee on Wednesday directed state agencies to take immediate and longer-term steps to protect the struggling killer whales. 
 
 The fish-eating mammals that spend time in Puget Sound have struggled for years with a lack of food, pollution, noise and disturbances from boat traffic. There are now just 76 of the orcas, down from 98 in 1995. 
 
 Inslee said the orcas are in trouble and called on everyone in the state to do their part. His executive order aims to make more salmon available to the whales, give them more space and quieter waters, ensure they have clean water to swim in and protect them from potential oil spills. 
 
 “The destiny of salmon and orca and we humans are intertwined,” the governor said at a news conference at the Daybreak Star Cultural Center in Seattle. “As the orca go, so go we.” 
 
 An orca task force forming now will meet for the first time next month and will come up with final recommendations by November. 
 
 “This is a wake-up call,” Suquamish Tribal Chairman Leonard Forsman said, adding, “It’s going to take some pain. We’re going to have to make some sacrifices.” 
 
 Many have been sounding the alarm for years about the plight of the closely tracked population of southern resident killer whales. The federal government listed the orcas as endangered in 2005, and more recently identified them as among the most at risk of extinction in the near future. 
 
 A baby orca has not been born in the past few years. Half of the calves born during a celebrated baby boom several years ago have died. Female orcas also are having pregnancy problems linked to nutritional stress brought on by a low supply of chinook salmon, the whales’ preferred food, a recent study said. 
 
 “We are not too late,” said Barry Thom, West Coast regional administrator for NOAA Fisheries. “From a biology perspective, there are still enough breeding animals, but we need to act soon.” 
 
 Whale advocates welcomed the statewide initiative, saying it creates urgency and calls attention to the issue. But some also said it was long overdue. 
 
 “I think that everybody would have loved to have seen this five years ago,” said Joe Gaydos, science director for the SeaDoc Society. “It is a crisis. The fact that we’re responding is good.” 
 
 Under the order, state agencies will find ways to quiet state ferries around the whales, train more commercial whale-watching boats to help respond to oil spills and adjust fishing regulations to protect key areas and fish runs for orcas. 
 
 The whales use clicks, calls and other sounds to navigate, communicate and forage mainly for salmon, and noise from vessels can interfere. 
 
 Lawmakers also passed a supplemental budget last week that includes $1.5 million for efforts such as a boost in marine patrols to ensure that boats keep their distance from orcas and an increase in hatchery production of salmon by an additional 5 million. 
 
 Last year, the endangered orcas spent the fewest number of days in the central Salish Sea that spans Washington and Canada in four decades, mostly because there wasn’t enough salmon to eat, according to the Center for Whale Research, which keeps the whale census for the federal government. 
 
 “I applaud anything that helps (the orcas) through the short term, but the long term is what we really have to look at — and that’s the restoration of wild salmon stocks throughout Washington state,” Ken Balcomb, senior scientist with the center, said Tuesday. 
 
 Balcomb and others say aggressive measures are needed and they have called for the removal of four dams on the Lower Snake River to restore salmon runs. 
 
 J.T. Austin, the governor’s senior policy adviser on natural resources issues, said Inslee so far does not support removing those dams. ||||| WCT killer whales may be well adapted behaviourally for performing infanticide because of their experience killing other small cetaceans. Individuals typically dispatch these prey by ramming or crushing them with their rostrums or tails36. Observations of infanticidal behaviour towards young common bottlenose dolphins, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins and a Guiana dolphin by conspecifics have included repeated ramming and crushing actions but also forced submergence4,5,6,7,8,9. Although we did not observe the first few minutes of this incident closely enough to determine the details of interactions that took place, it appeared as though T046B5 was quickly immobilized by having its tail gripped in the teeth of T068A and subsequently drowned because there was no opportunity to surface and breath due to his consistent forward motion. Although both T068 and T068A were observed with fresh teeth scars after the incident, the only ramming behaviour we observed was performed by T046B toward her neonateâ€™s killer. This combative behaviour is similar to actions directed towards infanticidal males by the mothers of targeted infants in several rodent, primate and carnivore species (see review in13). The ramming occurred approximately ten minutes after the incident began, at which point the neonate would have been either close to or freshly drowned, which is probably why the fight did not persist. The brevity of this physical aggression might be typical of agonistic interactions between members of the WCT killer whale population. This, in addition to the fact that most exchanges between individuals take place below the surface, may help explain why none of this nature have previously been observed. Similarly, anomalistic calls are not commonly made by whales in this population42, but as many animals are known to produce atypical sounds under stressful situations43, the high number of aberrant and discrete pulsed calls and other excited sounds recorded before and during the infanticide event likely reflect the levels of intensity in the complex interactions taking place between individuals. For example, the fresh trauma observed on T046B4 at the beginning of this encounter indicates that other rough interaction between the whales occurred prior to our arrival. This may have caused the T046Bs to separate into two groups to benefit the neonate and the other young animals through their disassociation from it, but vocalizations between them and their ultimate re-grouping may have revealed their locations to the T068s. 
 
 The motivation for T068A and T068 to make this attack is of particular interest, but that they carried it out cooperatively is not surprising because bonds between maternally related killer whales can be particularly strong34. In sympatric populations, post-reproductive female killer whales increase the survival of adult sons by sharing ecological knowledge and prey with them44,45. This benefits inclusive fitness of the female because a positive relationship exists between reproductive success and age in male killer whales45,46. This combined with a prediction by Connor et al.47 that post-reproductive female killer whales may play a role in acquiring mates for their adult male offspring suggests that T068â€™s active involvement in this event was sexually selected, especially considering that T068A is of a reproductively mature age30,46. The sexual selection hypothesis requires that the infanticidal male does not kill his own offspring, that the event provides a near future mating opportunity with the infantsâ€™ mother and that he sires offspring with her12. Although it has been confirmed in many other mammal species that infanticidal males are not the fathers of their victims48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55 and that they subsequently sire offspring with the infants mothers13,15,51,53,55,56,57, in this incident the neonateâ€™s carcass could not be recovered, T068A was not biopsied for DNA analysis and T046B has not yet had another calf. 
 
 However, further evidence also suggests that the infanticidal teamwork of T068 and T068A was motivated by potential to increase their inclusive fitness. For example, young offspring are often selected for infanticide because new mothers return to estrus much quicker than those that have been lactating for longer periods of time12. In this case, we know that T046B5 was less than a few days old and that suckling stimulates lactation in female killer whales whose postpartum return to estrus is much longer (5â€“32 months) when lactating than when not (1â€“4 months)58. Secondly, females in some animal societies copulate more with coercive males59,60 that restrict parental investment and improve the female condition by committing infanticide to increase their fitness61. In this case, although it is not clear if the attack on T046B4 was attempted juvenilicide, this whale (although third youngest in the group) was T046Bs second youngest offspring, so its death along with loss of her neonate could have benefitted her condition by reducing any prohibitive physical costs associated with caring for either of them. This would help restrict parental investment towards any forthcoming offspring of T068A if he successfully mated with T046B. Furthermore, infanticidal males are typically not familiar with the infantâ€™s mothers13 and although unrelated matrilineal groups of WCT killer whales have often been known to spend several weeks together40 in what have generally been perceived to be mutual associations, T068A, T068 and T046B had only been documented together on two previous occasions â€“ once in 2005 and again in 2007. The apparent low levels of association between these individuals suggest that they are not well known to each other and this may be reflective of inherent sexual conflict between their differing sex and age classes. 
 
 Sexually selected infanticide in WCT killer whales has important implications for our understanding of the social behaviour and evolution of this species (Supplementary Discussion S1) and although in this case, the hypothesis cannot be proven, there is more supporting evidence for it than other hypotheses for this behaviour. For example, WCT killer whales are well known for their dramatic hunting behaviour and protracted kills that typically result in immediate vocal and social activity, including division and consumption of mammalian prey36,62. However, in this incident the vocal and social activity subsided once the kill was made and although the dead neonate was kept in the possession of its killers for at least 220â€‰minutes, there was no indication that it was dismembered or consumed. Additionally, most prey species that WCT killer whales target have been steadily increasing in coastal waters over the last few decades63,64,65,66,67,68,69. These increases in prey availability have been commensurate with increasing social activity70 and higher recruitment within the WCT population39 suggesting that it is not nutritionally stressed. Thus, this incident is not easily explained by the predation hypothesis. Furthermore, although the WCT population has more than doubled in size since 199039, there is little evidence available to suggest that individuals within it compete for habitat or prey71. Regardless, these and the availability of other resources such as mates would not easily be threatened by an infant of either sex due to the slow rate of maturation in this species. Thus, this incident is not easily explained by the resource competition hypothesis. Finally, there is little support for interpreting infanticide as a non-adaptive behaviour other than when it occurs by accident or under unnatural conditions13,53,72 and contrary to accidental or pathological explanations, the infanticidal behaviour of T068A and T068 appeared goal oriented because their chase led to an attack that was maintained until a particular outcome had been achieved. Once it had, their behaviour immediately changed. 
 
 In conclusion, given that infanticide is so rarely observed in terrestrial mammals it is not surprising that it has taken many years of directed field observations to confirm that it does occur in cetaceans and more specifically, in killer whales. This species shares many life history traits with other mammals that are known to commit infanticide (see1), such as a high lactation to gestation ratio58, a society where individuals live in stable mixed sex groups where calves are born year round71 and a breeding system that is monopolized by a minority of mature males46. As a result, this phenomenon might be expected to occur in more killer whale populations than just the WCT. In any case, additional study is required to investigate any impacts that this phenomenon may have on the evolution of the social structure of this population and the behaviour of individuals within it.
