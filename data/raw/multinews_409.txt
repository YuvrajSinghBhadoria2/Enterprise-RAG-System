 Late Night with Seth Meyers 
 
 http://www.youtube.com/user/latenight... ||||| Many have turned their backs on Donald Trump following his comments about immigration, but one former controversial beauty queen feels torn. 
 
 Miss USA 2006 Tara Conner made headlines during her year wearing the crown after reports surfaced that the she was underage drinking and eventually tested positive for cocaine. 
 
 Instead of stripping the title from the pageant queen, Trump offered her a second chance and allowed her to enter rehab, so his recent choice of words took Conner by surprise. 
 
 Donald Trump's public feuds 
 
 "He did a huge service for me and he really helped me out a lot," she shared with the Daily News. "Because I feel like he took such a strong step forward for the recovery movement by sending me to treatment and breaking the stigma in that way but when we throw around words like rapists and druggies it's extremely irresponsible because it adds to the stigma of addiction."

 "If you're gonna make such a strong comment on a race or even just people in general maybe back that up with: how are you gonna help people in recovery and make that more of an option for people who are struggling with addiction and alcoholism, instead of just adding to the stigma?" 
 
 Regardless of her distaste for his word choice, the former Miss USA admits if she saw him now she would just feel gratitude. 
 
 "I would be very gracious for what he has done for me and my life because he helped change my life, I will forever be grateful for that," she explained. 
 
 The former Miss USA, who the media referred to as "Mess America," says she has been sober for 8 ½ years, but still struggles with the disease every day. 
 
 "I still have my days where I wake up and feel unhealthy and that's when I have to use the tools that I've been given or that I've learned so that I can try to get back in the healthy chair because you don't just get sober and you graduate and you're fine, it's a disease I'm gonna have for the rest of my life, but I have to make that choice every day that I wake up," she shared.

 “That is a two-way street,” Meyers pointed out, noting that Donald Trump has been targeting O’Donnell for a very long time. Perhaps most famous was the moment during the first Republican primary debate when Trump responded to Megyn Kelly’s question about his history of misogynistic statements by saying, “Only Rosie O’Donnell.” 
 
 “Over a decade,” O’Donnell said. 
 
 It all started back when O’Donnell was co-hosting The View. As she explained, there was a young woman who had recently been crowned “Junior Miss Trump Atlantic City Pageant Sexist Winner,” as O’Donnell put it, when she was “caught” by the New York Post kissing a woman at a bar downtown. Trump held a press conference and announced that he had forgiven her for her transgressions. 
 
 “What is he, the pimp and she’s the prostitute?” O’Donnell remembered saying at the time. “He’s the moral arbiter of 20-year-old behavior now, right?” From there, she went on to talk about how he has been “bankrupt four times, that he got all his money from his father, and that he notoriously cheats private contractors out of their money.” 
 
 After she said all that on The View, Trump “went batshit crazy.” 
 
 “So, you know, as bad as everyone feels and they have felt since November 8th, I know for me, I’ve been in a severe depression,” O’Donnell told Meyers. “Although, I’d like to say, today after your show I’m going to get a Bob Mueller tattoo. Because I love him!” 
 
 When Meyers described Mueller as a “severe” man, O’Donnell said, “He looks to me like Superman. Like Captain America. Like justice has finally arrived back on our shores! And we are going to right ourselves again!” 
 
 “I will say that if Trump gets indicted, it would be really great if Mueller let you serve the papers,” Meyers replied. 
 
 O’Donnell said that when Trump first rode down that escalator to announce his campaign she was “laughing her ass off” because she thought it “would never happen.” Even her therapist assured her that Trump could never actually win the election. 
 
 How wrong they were.
