A well-done movie musical is a great equalizer: It can make audiences feel like they’re in the front row at a Broadway show without the sticker shock. Bill Condon’s lavish live-action “Beauty and the Beast” pulls this off, sticking closely enough to the original that it should satisfy its legions of fans — among which, I confess, I’ve never really counted myself. 
 
 The 1991 “Beauty” always felt like minor Disney to me, a step down for the “Little Mermaid” team Howard Ashman and Alan Menken. But, devotees, let’s agree to disagree because this version of the tale about a cursed prince and the plucky bookworm whose love redeems him has something for everyone. 
 
 Emma Watson fleshes out the heroine, Belle, courtesy of screenwriters Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos. She’s a fledgling inventor (instead of her dad, Maurice, played by Kevin Kline), a mentor to girls in her 18th-century village who want to read, and is unafraid to tell her boorish suitor, Gaston (a perfect, preening Luke Evans) that she’s too young have kids. Watson carries a passable tune, and her eyes have the sparkle of a damsel who’s prepared to come to her own rescue. 
 
 Dan Stevens (“Downton Abbey”), as the Beast, has the heaviest lift. He’s emoting through a CGI veil that never quite feels real. But his cranky character is more engaging this time around. He’s a fellow reader who doesn’t treat Belle with chivalrous kid gloves. In their snowball fight, he actually goes through with lobbing a gigantic one at her, knocking her to the ground. It’s a weirdly slapstick moment, but I liked it. When has a Disney princess ever been treated like the love interest in a Farrelly brothers movie? 
 
 The castle’s animated inanimate objects — a candlestick (Ewan McGregor), clock (Ian McKellen), teapot (Emma Thompson), wardrobe (Audra McDonald) and feather duster (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), plus Stanley Tucci as a piano — stump along pretty much like they did in the cartoon. McGregor’s rendition of “Be Our Guest” is a retro-styled showstopper, though I can’t say the same of the three new songs, which just increase the soundtrack’s clunkers-to-classics ratio. 
 
 And about that gay subplot? Yup, it’s obvious LeFou (Josh Gad, every musical’s secret weapon) has a thing for his buddy — the tavern singalong “Gaston,” the film’s best number, all but spells it out. There’s a brief shot of two men dancing, and a scene in which one redneck villager, magicked into a dress and makeup, responds with delight instead of horror. It’s also worth noting that Ashman, who died of complications from AIDS in 1991, saw the cursed Beast as a metaphor for the disease. So if you loved the original, you’ve already embraced a gay subtext. 
 
 Other (light) modernist touches abound. The witch, who initially curses the prince, pops up throughout the film: “Do you know what happens to spinsters whose fathers die?” Gaston growls at Belle, gesturing at a beggar woman. She’ll later be the one who saves Belle’s dad. When Gaston fearmongers villagers into storming the Beast’s castle, it hums with a certain topicality; likewise the flock of books fighting back against an illiterate mob. 
 
 Really, everybody wins. If you want your old favorite dressed in sumptuous new clothes, that’s what you’ll get. Those who always desired a little more depth from “Beauty and the Beast” will be happy, too: There’s something there that wasn’t there before. ||||| Video (01:59) : The fantastic journey of Belle, a bright, beautiful and independent young woman who is taken prisoner by a beast in his castle. 
 
 In 1991, Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast” became the first animated film nominated for the best picture Oscar. The studio’s live action and computer-graphic remake likely won’t have to worry about the Academy Awards. 
 
 Don’t misunderstand: It is a visually sumptuous, highly watchable extravaganza. It musically honors its earlier version, providing greatest-hits cover versions of the classic songs by Alan Menken, plus four originals. It welcomes a new generation of viewers with the “Harry Potter” audience appeal of Emma Watson in the progressive, quasi-feminist leading role. In short, the movie, directed by Bill Condon (of “Chicago,” “Dreamgirls” and two “Twilight Saga” entries), is fine. 
 
 Beauty and the Beast ★★½ out of 4 stars Rating: PG, some action, violence, peril and frightening images. 
 
 But it’s also less magical than what the studio achieved with two-dimensional illustrations a quarter-century ago. Watching it puts one in the mind of Belle’s obligatory marriage to the formerly brooding Beast once he returns to well-mannered human form. Wasn’t the relationship more interesting the way it was before? 
 
 The story remains faithful to the original narrative, a search for love balancing chaste purity and brutish effrontery in various forms. As Belle, Watson gives a revisionist dose of girl power clout to the role, making her as bookish and quick-witted as Hermione Granger. She is the inventive daughter of Maurice (Kevin Kline, his lengthy hair and beard a frenzy of 18th-century frizzies), who tinkers at windup music boxes. With her mother passed on, he protects their child carefully, perhaps a bit too cautiously for a plucky mademoiselle. She’s clearly prepared to venture into the world beyond her provincial village, but lovingly confined by her controlling cher papa. 
 
 When a sales trip puts Maurice in conflict with a onetime prince mysteriously turned enchanted Beast, he’s imprisoned inside its gothic castle. Belle sets out to free him, first confronting the Beast, then taking her father’s place as its captive. Before you can say “Stockholm syndrome,” she sees the decency beneath his animalistic exterior and begins to warm his icy heart. They even have a giggly snowball fight on the castle’s outdoor walkways. 
 
 Can their cross-species romance bloom before the last petal falls from a bewitched rose, the countdown clock for the curse that turned him feral (and his servants into a talking clock, candelabra and teapot)? Relax. They’re updating the tale, not rewriting it. 
 
 The emotional pull of old-school romantic fantasy is remarkably effective, and it’s improved by the subplot of egotistical Gaston, a wartime veteran intent to become Belle’s mate by any means necessary. This blustering, increasingly menacing macho beast of his own type is played by Luke Evans in entertaining numskull fashion. A pompous narcissist, he’s seemingly clueless about why his oh-so-warm helper, Le Fou (Josh Gad), wants to go from being Gaston’s faithful sidekick to his best friend forever and ever. When Le Fou’s not-very-surprising motivation is revealed, it’s much ado about nothing, as it should be. 
 
 As if to amp up the animated film’s handsome design, the photorealist computer imagery is a surreal swirl of rococo detail befitting a shop selling lavish French provincial clothing and housewares. More of that attention should have been directed to the acting. 
 
 Watson, a skilled performer, brings little fire to her role, developing apparent affection for the big animal rather than life-changing love. Her singing, a key to defining the character, is good but far from great. And as the Beast, Dan Stevens is a virtual invisible man, remaining hidden beneath a part wolf, part water buffalo false face. He adds considerably less value than Emma Thompson’s performance as a chatty maternal teapot. 
 
 I’m not suggesting they should have had more screen time to develop their characters. Running at a pokey two hours plus, it’s a full 45 minutes longer than the nimble earlier version. The new version is an underperforming example of more being considerably less. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.
