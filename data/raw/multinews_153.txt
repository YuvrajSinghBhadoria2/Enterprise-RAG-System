 A Pennsylvania man was briefly the richest man in the world–or maybe the poorest. 
 
 Chris Reynolds opened his PayPal statement and was shocked to read that he had $92 quadrillion in his account. “Well, initially I was a little jolted because I saw a negative number in front of a lot of digits and I just decided to have a little fun with it,” Reynolds said. 
 
 He posted a copy of the statement on Facebook, which garnered a few laughs from his friends. 
 
 The actual amount read “-92, 233, 720, 368, 547, 800.00.” PayPal immediately recognized the error and sought to rectify the situation. “PayPal was really good by the way,” Reynolds assured. “They apologized for any inconvenience.” 
 
 The public relations executive used to use PayPal when he bought vintage car parts and other supplies through eBay because the companies have a joint venture together. 
 
 PayPal agreed to make a “modest,” donation to any nonprofit organization of Reynolds’ choice, which remains undisclosed. ||||| A REAL PAL WILL GIVE you a dollar when you're in need, but a PayPal will give you $92 quadrillion. 
 
 Delaware County resident Chris Reynolds received just such a shocking delivery from PayPal on Friday, when he opened his monthly statement from the online money-transfer company via email and saw that his ending balance was $92,233,720,368,547,800. 
 
 "I'm just feeling like a million bucks," Reynolds told the Daily News yesterday. "At first I thought that I owed quadrillions. It was quite a big surprise." 
 
 Reynolds, 56, of Media, said he's been a PayPal customer for about 10 years and uses it to buy and sell items on eBay, including vintage car parts. He said he usually spends no more than $100 a month using PayPal.
