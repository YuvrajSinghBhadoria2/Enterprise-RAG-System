 Assad, whose regime has been condemned by the West, the Arab League and former allies, dismissed suggestions that he step down and scoffed at sanctions being imposed on Syria.

 His defiant stance was on display in an exclusive interview with ABC News' Barbara Walters who confronted the Syrian dictator in Damascus with stories and evidence of civilians being tortured and killed, some of them children. 
 
 "People went from house to house. Children were arrested. I saw those pictures," Walters said to Assad. 
 
 "To be frank with you, Barbara, you don't live here. How did you know all this...? This...you have to be here to see," Assad said. 
 
 Walters asked Assad about the case of Hamza al-Khateeb, a 13-year-old boy detained by Syrian forces after a protest whose lifeless body was returned to his parents shot, burned and castrated. The boy's death galvanized protesters, and photos on the internet inflamed world opinion. 
 
 Assad Tells Barbara Walters Violence Is By Terrorists, Not His Troops Assad denied the boy had been tortured. "No, no, no. It's not news," he insisted. "I met with his father, the father of that child and he said that he wasn't tortured as he appeared in the media." 
 
 The tide of pro-democracy protests sweeping the Arab world reached Syria in mid-March and news of violent clashes between protesters and government agents have leaked out of this tightly controlled dictatorship and on to the Internet. The bodies of the dead, some of them children, have been found bearing the marks of torture. 
 
 According to a United Nations report released last week, more than 4,000 people have been killed and the country is embroiled in an undeclared civil war, an assessment Assad dismissed with the question, "Who said that the United Nations is a credible institution?" 
 
 In an unprecedented condemnation of a fellow Muslim nation, the Arab League recently imposed sanctions, and last month one-time ally Turkey called on Assad to resign the presidency, an office he's held since 2000. 
 
 In his interview with Walters, his first sit down with an American journalist since the protests began, Assad denied he ordered a crackdown and blamed the violence on criminals, religious extremists and terrorists sympathetic to al Qaeda he claims are mixed in with peaceful demonstrators. 
 
 He said the victims of the street violence were not civilians protesters battling decades of one-party rule, he insisted. 
 
 "Most of the people that have been killed are supporters of the government, not the vice versa," he said. The dead have included 1,100 soldiers and police, he said. 
 
 Assad conceded only that some members of his armed forces went too far, but claims they were punished for their actions. 
 
 "Every 'brute reaction' was by an individual, not by an institution, that's what you have to know," he said. "There is a difference between having a policy to crackdown and between having some mistakes committed by some officials. There is a big difference," said Assad. 
 
 "But you have to give the order," countered Walters. 
 
 "We don't kill our people… no government in the world kills its people, unless it's led by a crazy person," Assad said. 
 
 At another point he said, "There was no command to kill or be brutal." 
 
 Syria's Assad Scoff as Threat of Sanctions 
 
 In an echo of recently deposed Arab strongmen, Assad said he was introducing reforms and elections, starting with local elections this year. The vote on his presidency isn't scheduled until 2014, a wait that may be too long for Syrian dissidents. But the elections can't be rushed, Assad said. 
 
 "We never said we are democratic country… We are moving forward in reforms, especially in the last nine months… It takes a long time, it takes a lot of maturity to be full fledged democracy." 
 
 Assad said the threat of sanctions did not worry him. "We've been under sanctions for the last 30, 35 years. It's not something new." 
 
 Despite the decades of economic sanctions, "We're not isolated. You have people coming and going, you have trade, you have everything," he said. 
 
 Walters asked Assad if he regretted the violence that has wracked his country, left thousands dead and make Syria a pariah state. 
 
 "I did my best to protect the people," he said. "I cannot feel guilty when you do your best. You feel sorry for the lives that have been lost. But you don't feel guilty when you don't kill people. So it's not about guilty." 
 
 (Editor's note: Due to a transcription error, the initial version of this story misstated Syrian President Bashar al-Assad quote in response to Barbara Walters question about Syrian forces allegedly going from house to house, arresting children. His actual quote was: "To be frank with you, Barbara, you don't live here. How did you know all this...? This...you have to be here to see.") ||||| Seventeen years after she changed daytime television forever with a newfangled talk show called The View, Barbara Walters is ending her storied career with an emotional goodbye on Friday. The TV news icon, who will remain as an executive producer of the daytime chatfest and will return to ABC News sporadically, has a special fondness for the show she launched back in 1994. 
 
 [Related: Ranking the 11 Ladies of 'The View' From Least to Most Memorable] 
 
 "It's a program that I created with great pride that's lasted longer than most shows on TV," Walters told TV Guide. And while she noted that in her 50-year television career she was never able to book a pope or Queen Elizabeth, she has interviewed just about everybody else. And many of those interviews took place on The View. 
 
 Here's a look back at some of Walters's most memorable interviews on The View: 
 
 The Time She Made a Future President Blush 
 
 President Barack Obama has appeared on The View several times (his joint appearance with the First Lady was a major "get" for Walters's daytime show), but one of his earliest pit stops on the show — when he was still a senator — had Walters gushing over his good looks. When Obama revealed that Brad Pitt is his very distant cousin but said the actor "got the better-looking side of the gene pool," Walters chimed in with, "Maybe we shouldn't say this, but we thought you were very sexy-looking!" 
 
 Parenting With a Pop Icon 
 
 It's not every day that the Material Girl stops by a daytime talk show, but in 2005, Madonna was a guest on The View, where she talked about everything from pop culture to parenting. But Walters called the singer out on one key point: "You've contributed more to pop culture than probably any one person, but you don't let your kids watch television. You say it's poison. Here you are on television!" she said. Madge explained that she grew up in a TV-free home and was concerned that television is "very seductive and very mesmerizing." "I would prefer to encourage them to use other parts of their brain," she said. 
 
 Doubting Thomas? 
 
 Walters has no problem talking religion. When she interviewed "Angels & Demons" star Tom Hanks and director Ron Howard, she asked the question point-blank: "Do you believe in an afterlife?" Hanks gave a long-winded answer about atoms, while Howard said, "I suspect there's something. I don't exactly know what … I can't imagine that there's not another dimension." 
 
 Livin' La Vida Barbara 
 
 Ten years after she aggressively (and, by her own admission, inappropriately) questioned Ricky Martin's sexuality in a TV interview, Walters interviewed him again on The View. When the TV news veteran asked the singer about the "darker period in his life," Martin corrected her: "Darker period? Barbara, I'm gonna call it a period of enlightenment. Let's call it that way, because it makes me feel better." The singer dished that everything changed when he decided to become a father to twin boys. 
 
 From Bullied to "Born This Way" 
 
 In 2011, Lady Gaga stopped by The View dressed all in black and wearing bizarre platform heels, telling Walters, "Well this is just the way I am. I was born this way." The pop superstar also revealed that when she was in school, she wanted to "wear a mask all the time" because she got bullied. "Getting picked on in school, it sticks with you for life," she said. "I don't think I realized how deeply it affected me until I started to become successful." 
 
 And here are a few of Walters's "View" interviews that didn't go so well: 
 
 A Guest Gets Grilled 
 
 In 2012, the news legend's interview with alleged John F. Kennedy mistress Mimi Alford took a tacky turn when she shamed the new author for writing a book about her tryst with the president more than 50 years after his death. Walters's condescending intro ("She'll make a lot of money!") and incessant prediction that Alford would "sell a lot of books" wasn't exactly welcoming. The View creator also asked Alford if she had given any thought to how her allegations would hurt JFK's daughter Caroline Kennedy, and even insinuated she could have saved Monica Lewinsky major pain if she'd told her story sooner. 
 
 A Former Church Secretary Speaks — Out of Turn 
 
 Speaking of affairs, in 2011, "View" guest Jessica Hahn gave Walters a dose of her own medicine when she was grilled about her scandalous relationship with married TV evangelist Jim Bakker. The former church secretary pointed out that Walters wrote about her own affair with married Sen. Edward Brooke in her book "Audition." Walters fired back with, "This is about you, my dear, this is not about me," then kept quiet for most of the interview after that. ||||| A look back at some of Barbara Walters' memorable interviews since she joined ABC in 1976.
