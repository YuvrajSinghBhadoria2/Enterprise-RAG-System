 MIAMI (AP) — Officials at SeaWorld say the last killer whale has been born in captivity at one of its parks — in San Antonio. 
 
 The orca's birth Wednesday afternoon comes in the wake of a decision by the Florida-based company in 2016 to stop breeding killer whales. SeaWorld didn't immediately name the calf because the park's veterinarians had not yet determined whether it was male or female. 
 
 The mother, 25-year-old Takara, was already pregnant last year when SeaWorld said it stopped the breeding program. The gestation period for orcas is about 18 months. SeaWorld says the mother had a smooth delivery and both appeared healthy. 
 
 SeaWorld's chief zoological officer, Chris Dold, told The Associated Press by phone that the birth was one of those "extraordinary moments." ||||| Last orca whale bred at SeaWorld born in San Antonio

 The final orca calf to be bred in captivity at SeaWorld was born Wednesday at the company's San Antonio park, a milestone in the company’s bid to end orca breeding at its theme parks following years of controversy. 
 
 Takara, a 25-year-old female orca, gave birth to the calf after an 18-month pregnancy at around 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, the company said in a news release sent late Wednesday night. The orca was already pregnant when SeaWorld announced last year it was ending its orca breeding program in March. SeaWorld believes Kyuquot, one of two male orcas at SeaWorld San Antonio, is the father, but officials will need to do a paternity test to know for sure. 
 
 “We are very excited by the birth of Takara’s calf and look forward to introducing her to our guests very soon,” SeaWorld San Antonio Carl Lum said in a statement. 
 
 More than two dozen orcas will continue to live in the Orlando-based theme park operator's parks for decades to come, including five in San Antonio. Takara already has four children, two of which live at the San Antonio park.

 SeaWorld is billing the San Antonio calf's birth as the last opportunity for park visitors and researchers to witness and observe a young orca's maturation outside of the wild, which the company says is vital to understand orcas at large. 
 
 “Although this is the last killer whale birth at a SeaWorld park, our work to understand and protect this species will continue for decades to come,” Hendrik Nollens, vice president of veterinary services for SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, said in the release. 
 
 Outside researchers will have access to the calf and its mother. Heather Hill, a St. Mary’s University professor who studies animal behavior, will monitor sleep patterns of the mother and her newborn calf. Another researcher with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will track how contaminants and toxins transfer from mother to offspring, data that could be useful in combating pollution’s effects on orca populations in the wild. 
 
 The calf will be visible to visitors either in the orca stadium pool at the San Antonio park or in two adjacent pools. 
 
 SeaWorld’s chief zoological officer, Chris Dold said veterinarians at the San Antonio park told him the calf was born normally — tail first — after about an hour and a half of smooth labor. Both orcas were swimming calmly, including taking breaths at the water’s surface, and trainers would be watching for the calf to begin nursing. 
 
 “Mom generally will rest but she can’t rest too much .... mom’s not holding onto the calf, but it’s riding in her slipstream, and that’s how it gets around,” Dold said. “Our expectation is that all of this will go smoothly, but we take none of that for granted.” 
 
 Takara got pregnant naturally, something SeaWorld hopes to prevent in the future. It has the nation’s best veterinary and scientific experts working to prevent conception, SeaWorld San Antonio spokeswoman Gayle MacIntyre said last month. “This includes medical efforts, such as monitoring ovarian cycles and birth control, as well as social management to reduce the likelihood of conception.” 
 
 SeaWorld is also revamping orcas' role in the parks’ programming. The company is working to emphasize natural and educational encounters instead of the flashier shows and mammal-based entertainment the company is known for. 
 
 The company has previously said it also plans to plug millions of dollars into rides, events and other attractions — including at least $18 million to build the Wave Breaker roller coaster at its San Antonio park. The ride, intended to simulate marine animal rescue efforts, is slated to open in June. 
 
 SeaWorld ended its orca breeding program following years of backlash sparked by the 2013 documentary film "Blackfish," which scrutinized the Orlando-based theme park operator’s treatment of orcas. Declining stock value and falling attendance at its parks in the wake of the documentary have forced the company to retool its public image as an eco-friendly entertainment group that provides educational experiences alongside attractions like roller coasters and water parks. 
 
 Attendance fell by 471,000 visitors in 2016, a 2.1 percent drop from 2015. SeaWorld also posted a net loss of $12.5 million, or 15 cents a share, for 2016 — compared with $49.1 million in profit, or 57 cents a share, the previous year. 
 
 The theme park operator cut 320 employees in December as part of a company-wide restructuring program intended to eliminate $65 million in costs and generate $40 million in net savings by December 2018. That round of layoffs included eleven employees at the San Antonio park, Lum said at the time. 
 
 California Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation last fall banning the breeding of killer whales and their use in entertainment shows, codifying SeaWorld's pledge to end its breeding program with legislation. 
 
 Tilikum — the orca who killed SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010 and main subject of "Blackfish" — sired 14 calves over 25 years. He died of a bacterial infection in January.
