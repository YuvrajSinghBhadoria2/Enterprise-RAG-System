COLUMBIA, S.C. (WACH)-- A Richland County administrator is now without a job just days after being accused of telling EMS workers they could kill themselves if they did not like their working conditions. 
 
 The accusations surfaced last week as former County Assistant Administrator Kevin Bronson was handed numerous employee concerns at an internal meeting. 
 
 In response to his employees, Bronson reportedly responded by saying “if it’s really that bad you can just kill yourself or leave.” 
 
 Bronson sent out an apology letter to his worker saying that his comment was insensitive and inappropriate. However former paramedic Baron O’Neal says that an apology just isn’t enough. 
 
 "Number 1 they're overworked. Number 2, they're underpaid. Then they get slapped with 'if you don't like it, leave or kill yourself," said O'Neal. 
 
 
 
 In his resignation letter, Bronson wrote “My disrespectful words hurt and offended many people, especially the EMS wokers. I am sorry” 
 
 Meanwhile O’Neal says he is conversing with County Council to improve work conditions. 
 
 County leaders say they want to hear about workers concerns so they can determine if anything can be done to address the situation. ||||| Sign in using you account with: {* loginWidget *}
