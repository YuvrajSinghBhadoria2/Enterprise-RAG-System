 Yes ||||| Norm Macdonald’s way of handling a controversy appears to be to create a new one. 
 
 The comedian experienced swift fallout over his victim-blaming comments to the Hollywood Reporter while defending friends Louis C.K. and Roseanne Barr, leading him to issue an apology. It wasn’t enough for the Tonight Show, which disinvited him from the program just an hour before his appearance on Tuesday. By Wednesday, however, the star of the new Netflix show Norm MacDonald Has a Show had stirred up even more drama on The Howard Stern Show. While discussing the controversy, he said, “You’d have to have Down syndrome to not feel sorry” for victims of harassment. 
 
 
 
 
 
 During the Sirius XM interview, the former Saturday Night Live personality, who is 58, said he “never defended” Barr, who lost her job over racist remarks, or Louis C.K., who was dropped by FX after multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct. “I am completely behind the #MeToo movement,” MacDonald insisted. “You’d have to have Down syndrome to not feel sorry” for the victims of harassment. “#MeToo is what you want for your daughters and you want that to be the future world, of course. And I meet all kinds of women with terrible stories of what’s happened to them. So, I wasn’t talking about the victims. They asked me about Roseanne.” For good measure, he repeated himself: “Down syndrome. That’s my new word.” 
 
 Reactions to his latest controversial comments haven’t been kind. 
 
 NORM STOP TALKING. 
 
 Why put down people with Down Syndrome?🤦🏽‍♀️

 Dear @normmacdonald Down Syndrome is not something that prevents someone from having emotion, feeling empathy, or understanding the importance of a movement like #MeToo. Your statement is just inaccurate and does not qualify as an apology https://t.co/aB2rKlXU8K — Shannon Scully (@ShannonMScully) September 12, 2018 
 
 
 
 
 
 Norm McDonald: “Let me explain how much of an idiot I have been by insulting people born with Down Syndrome and their families” — Exavier Pope (@exavierpope) September 12, 2018 
 
 
 
 
 
 Oh, Norm! Is this an act? Surely you are not serious about people with Down Syndrome. I am very sad for you if you haven't experienced their unconditional love? — Etienne McD (@smcdonn4499) September 12, 2018 
 
 
 
 
 
 “I’m sorry I said that thing about Down Syndrome. That was totally gay of me.” — Norm Macdonald tomorrow, probably — Ish (@Ish) September 12, 2018 
 
 
 
 
 
 However, some of his fans found it to be a very calculated comment. 
 
 I LOVE HIM. If you think he accidentally included the Down Syndrome mention you've never listened to Norm. — Lyndsey Fifield (@lyndseyfifield) September 12, 2018 
 
 
 
 
 
 During his chat with the shock jock, Macdonald talked about Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon coming backstage personally to tell him that his invitation had been rescinded. Initially, the plan was to have Macdonald make a statement to smooth things over at the top of the show, but the plan changed. “Jimmy came back in, said, ‘Can I talk to you, buddy?’ He was very broken up about it. He said, ‘I don’t know what to do. It’s just that I have so much pressure. People are crying. Senior producers are crying.’ I said bring them in and let me talk to them. I don’t want to make people cry. Jimmy said, ‘Come back whenever you want, but I think it might hurt the show tonight.’” 
 
 Macdonald added that he spoke to Netflix content chief Ted Sarandos before he issued his apology Tuesday on Twitter. “He is one of the greatest people to ever come into my life,” he said. “He knows I am a good person. Ted said, ‘We don’t want to hear legalese; write your own thing.’” 
 
 Roseanne and Louis have both been very good friends of mine for many years. They both made terrible mistakes and I would never defend their actions. If my words sounded like I was minimizing the pain that their victims feel to this day, I am deeply sorry. — Norm Macdonald (@normmacdonald) September 11, 2018 ||||| Norm Macdonald told Howard Stern he was “confused” when he made controversial comments about the #MeToo movement in an interview published in The Hollywood Reporter on Tuesday. 
 
 Speaking with The Hollywood Reporter, Macdonald said he was “happy the #MeToo movement has slowed down a bit.” He also expressed concern that Louis C.K. “[lost] everything in a day” after admitting he was guilty of sexual misconduct. “Of course, people will go, ‘What about the victims?'” Macdonald said. “But you know what? The victims didn’t have to go through [losing everything in a day].” 
 
 On The Howard Stern Show, Macdonald did not apologize for those comments. “I wish I never had to do an interview, especially a print interview, because they edit it and put it together and ask you questions that maybe you don’t want to answer,” he said. 
 
 “I’m a fucking dumb guy, I get confused and shit,” he added. “[The Hollywood Reporter was] asking me about a whole bunch of things at the same time.” 
 
 Macdonald also suggested that his comments about victims were not interpreted correctly. “I said the victims went through worse [than Louis C.K.] but it wasn’t the same [as what he went through],” he added. “You’d have to have Down Syndrome to not feel sorry for [the victims of sexual misconduct]. #MeToo is what you want for your daughters. You want that to be the future world.” 
 
 Macdonald has a new show coming to Netflix, and the comedian’s press appearances this week was supposed to raise awareness about it. However, following his comments in The Hollywood Reporter, Macdonald’s planned appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon was cancelled. The comedian offered an apology on Twitter. “If my words sounded like I was minimizing the pain that their victims feel to this day, I am deeply sorry,” he wrote.
