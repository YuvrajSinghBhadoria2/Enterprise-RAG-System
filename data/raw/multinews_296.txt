SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The J.M. Smucker Co. is withdrawing some shipments of dog food amid reports that it could be tainted with traces of a drug used to euthanize animals. 
 
 The company said Thursday it is pulling back shipments of several varieties of wet canned Gravy Train , Kibble 'N Bits , Skippy and Ol' Roy brands. It said it is investigating how the euthanasia drug pentobarbital got into its supply chain and is focusing on a single supplier of a minor ingredient used at one manufacturing facility. 
 
 The recalls come after WJLA-TV in Washington, D.C., said it tested 15 cans of Gravy Train. It found nine cans, or 60 percent of the sample, tested positive for pentobarbital. 
 
 Smucker cited experts noting that the low levels of the drug cited in the report do not pose a threat to pets. 
 
 "However, the presence of this substance at any level is not acceptable to us and not up to our quality standards," said the company, which is based in Orrville, Ohio. It said it does not use meat from euthanized animals in its pet food. ||||| New Year’s Eve 2016 was no celebration for Nikki Mael and her family. 
 
 “Nobody should have to go through what we went through,” said Mael. “Nobody. Not fair. I mean, I would give anything to see Talula again.” 
 
 Within minutes of sharing a can of Evanger’s pet food among her five dogs, she was racing the lifeless animals to the emergency vet. 
 
 UPDATE: Dog foods pulled from shelves nationwide after ABC7 investigation finds euthanasia drug 
 
 “They were falling over. They were running into the walls. They were convulsing,” said Mael. 
 
 The vets told her they weren’t sure what was going on, but that things didn’t look good. Hours later, devastating news. 
 
 “They said Talula wasn’t going to make it,” said Mael, choking back tears. 
 
 Desperate for answers, the family sent the remainder of the food to a specialized lab and drove Talulah’s lifeless body to a veterinary pathologist for a postmortem examination. 
 
 “Poisoning from the dog food. That’s what killed her,” said Mael. 
 
 But it wasn’t just any poison. 
 
 It was pentobarbital: A lethal drug, most commonly used to euthanize dogs, cats and some horses. The deadly toxin is never permitted to kill animals that are part of the food supply and would violate federal law if it was. 
 
 “Pet food violates federal law, is openly allowed by the FDA to violate federal law, billion dollar a year companies are making profit selling illegal adulterated products to unknowing consumers in the US every day,” said Susan Thixton, a pet food consumer advocate who’s been studying and writing about the pet food industry for decades. 
 
 “Consumers have no information, “ said Thixton. “A consumer has to become a private detective to learn what’s really in their food.” 
 
 So we decided to find out. 
 
 We partnered with Ellipse Analytics, a lab that specializes in testing food for contaminants. 
 
 “I think you have a duty to understand what you’re selling to human beings and pets, and I think that the obligation is on you to understand what is, and is not, in your product,” said lab founder, Kevin Hicks. 
 
 We tested 62 samples of wet dog food, across more than two-dozen brands for the euthanasia drug pentobarbital. 
 
 After months of tests and re-tests, one brand repeatedly came back positive for pentobarbital. 
 
 In total, we tested 15 cans of Gravy Train. Nine cans — 60-percent of the sample — were positive for pentobarbital. And while the levels detected were not lethal, under federal law they are also not permitted at any concentration. 
 
 Gravy Train is made by Big Heart Pet Foods and owned by Smucker’s. According to Neilsen data, it accounts for more than $40 million of the company’s annual revenue. 
 
 Big Heart Brands is also the maker of Meow Mix, Milk Bone, Kibbles’n Bits, 9 Lives, Natural Balance, Pup-Peroni, Gravy Train, Nature’s Recipe, Canine Carry Outs, Milo’s Kitchen, Alley Cat, Jerky Treats, Meaty Bone, Pounce and Snausages. 
 
 The Big Heart website touts “high-quality food” that meets “rigorous evaluation and testing requirements.” 
 
 So how is pentobarbital, a drug not allowed to be used on animals intended for food, getting into the food? 
 
 “It comes from euthanasia of animals using that euthanasia drug,” said Dr. Nicholas Dodman, chief scientific officer for The Center for Canine Behavior Studies and former director of the Animal Behavior Program at Tufts University. “So, these animals could be dogs, they could be cats, they could be horses - but how is it getting into the pet food? If they say it doesn’t come from dogs, cats and horses where does it come from? It doesn’t come from outer space.” 
 
 Dodman says the level of pentobarbital in the food is really beside the point. 
 
 “Whether it’s doing something or nothing, what’s it doing there? Where did it come from? If they don’t like the explanation that it's coming from animals that have been euthanized, what is their explanation as to how it gets in?” asked Dodman. 
 
 We asked that question of both the FDA and Smucker’s as part of a request for an on-camera interview. Neither answered. 
 
 Smucker’s declined our request for an on-camera interview and declined to answer any of our questions we provided to them, but gave us a statement which in part, says “We launched and are conducting a thorough investigation, including working closely with our suppliers, to determine the accuracy of these results and the methodology used.” 
 
 The FDA, just a short distance from the WJLA studios, also declined repeated requests for an on-camera interview. Instead of speaking to us, and answering our questions, they suggested we contact the Pet Food Institute, which is the trade organization that represents 98 percent of the pet food industry. We asked them to reconsider that response to which they replied that it “will investigate the matter and take appropriate enforcement action.” 
 
 One possibility as to how pentobarbital is getting into food? Experts tell us animals that have been euthanized are picked up by renderers who process the carcasses - which may be blended into pet food. 
 
 In a 2004 report to Congress, sources for rendered materials were identified as, among other things, "dead animals from farms, animal shelters and other facilities." 
 
 Under federal law, these are adulterated ingredients. 
 
 Adulterated ingredients, which are defined partly as: “an animal which has died otherwise than by slaughter,” are illegal in all food for humans and animals. 
 
 Yet in its own compliance policy, the FDA acknowledges it is violating the law and states: “pet food consisting of material from diseased animals or animals which have died otherwise than by slaughter, which is in violation of 402(a)(5) will be considered fit for animal consumption.” 
 
 “The FDA tells industry ‘Yeah, it’s a violation of law, but go ahead, we’re not going to do anything,’” said Thixton. 
 
 In a written request, we asked the FDA to explain its policy that is allowing adulterated ingredients into pet food. 
 
 They did not provide an answer. 
 
 As for Nikki Mael and her family, she says their confidence as consumers has been irreparably damaged. “I don't trust any dog food companies anymore. And reading that the law’s not enforced and it’s just kind of, ‘they do their own thing,’ I need to make sure that they’re eating human grade food.” 
 
 Since Talula’s death, Nikki’s been making pet food at home, so she knows exactly what’s in it. She’s also the lead on a class action lawsuit against Evanger’s, the company that made the food the FDA attributes to Talula’s death. We tested several cans of Evanger’s for our report and those cans came back negative. 
 
 “I miss Talula a lot. Not fair. But I hope that other animals can be saved by this,” said Mael.

 Behind the scenes: How an analytical lab tests for contaminants in pet food: 
 
 
 
 ||||| Feb. 16, 2018 -- The FDA on Friday warned pet owners that several popular brands of dog food has been found to include small amounts of a drug used to euthanize animals. 
 
 The agency says it is investigating how pentobarbital wound up in certain shipments of Gravy Train, Kibbles 'N Bits, Ol’ Roy, and Skippy canned wet dog food. 
 
 "The FDA’s preliminary evaluation of the testing results of Gravy Train samples indicates that the low level of pentobarbital present in the withdrawn products is unlikely to pose a health risk to pets," the agency says in its advisory. "However, pentobarbital should never be present in pet food and products containing any amount of pentobarbital are considered to be adulterated." 
 
 J.M. Smucker Co., owner of the brands in question, said it has pulled specific shipments of Gravy Train, Kibbles 'N Bits, Ol’ Roy, and Skippy canned wet dog food. 
 
 The move, which is not considered an official recall, came after a Washington, D.C., television station said it had several varieties of dog food tested in an independent lab. Those results, WJLA said, found several products that tested positive for pentobarbital. Pentobarbital is a barbiturate drug that is most commonly used in animals as a sedative, anesthetic, or for euthanasia, the FDA says. 
 
 An agency spokeswoman told WebMD on Wednesday that the FDA is "thoroughly reviewing" the state's results and that the "agency will determine appropriate action." 
 
 “Veterinarians and animal nutrition specialists, as well as the FDA, have confirmed that extremely low levels of pentobarbital, like the levels reported to be in select shipments, do not pose a threat to pet safety,” J.M. Smucker Co. spokesman Ray Hancart told WebMD in a statement. “However, the presence of this substance at any level is not acceptable to us and not up to our quality standards. We sincerely apologize for the concern this has caused.” 
 
 Hancart says customers with questions or concerns can call 800-828-9980 or email the company through its website. 
 
 Hancart says the company continues to investigate and is “extremely disappointed that pentobarbital was introduced to our supply chain.” ||||| An independent investigation, conducted by ABC7, looking into what’s in your dog’s food was followed by recalls from a major pet food company. 
 
 According to ABC7, the ABC-affiliate launched the deep dive into dog food after the death of a Washougal, Washington, dog named Talula. Nikki Mael’s four dogs all became ill after eating a can of Evanger’s pet food on New Year’s Eve 2016. Distraught, the owner rushed all of her canines to the vet for treatment; all but Talula pulled through.

 Mael sent the remainder of her dogs’ food to a lab for testing. The lab uncovered that the dog food contained pentobarbital, “a lethal drug, most commonly used to euthanize dogs, cats and some horses.” The use of pentobarbital is not permitted in animal meat used for food supply, so it should not show up in any pet or human food. The FDA later cautioned pet owners against feeding their pets Evanger’s shortly after Talula’s death, but Susan Thixton, a pet food consumer advocate, told ABC7 that unusual substances can end up in your pets’ food regularly. 
 
 “Consumers have no information,” said Thixton. “A consumer has to become a private detective to learn what’s really in their food.” 
 
 To save pet owners the aforementioned detective work, ABC7 partnered with Ellipse Analytics, a lab specializing in food testing, to test pet food. 
 
 The station tested 62 samples of wet dog food from over 24 brands for pentobarbital multiple times over several months. Only one brand of food, Gravy Train, repeatedly tested positive for trace amounts of the euthanasia drug. Sixty percent of the Gravy Train samples came back positive. 
 
 And while the amount of pentobarbital found was not a lethal level, any trace of the drug is not permitted in pet food. 
 
 Gravy Train is made by the company Big Heart Pet Foods, which is owned by Smucker’s. Big Heart Brands is also responsible for the production of Meow Mix, Milk Bone, Kibbles’n Bits, 9 Lives, Natural Balance, Pup-Peroni, Nature’s Recipe, Canine Carry Outs, Milo’s Kitchen, Alley Cat, Jerky Treats, Meaty Bone, Pounce and Snausages. 
 
 The question still remains how the drug made its way into the food, since it is often only found in the systems of cats, horses and dogs put down by the drug. Some worry this means these animals are being put into pet food, reports ABC 7, while others are more concerned that the drug is there at all and what its presence means about the quality of the food we are feeding our pets. 
 
 Shortly after ABC7 shared its findings, Smucker’s announced Wednesday that it is voluntarily recalling shipments of Gravy Train, Kibbles ‘N Bits, Ol’ Roy, and Skippy dog food over concerns about the presence of pentobarbital, according to WebMD. 
 
 “Veterinarians and animal nutrition specialists, as well as the FDA, have confirmed that extremely low levels of pentobarbital, like the levels reported to be in select shipments, do not pose a threat to pet safety,” J.M. Smucker Co. spokesman Ray Hancart told WebMD in a statement. “However, the presence of this substance at any level is not acceptable to us and not up to our quality standards. We sincerely apologize for the concern this has caused.”
